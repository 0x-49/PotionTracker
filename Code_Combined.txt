File: C:\personal\LandingPage Affialte SEO\Replit_Final_3\PotionTrackerPro\PotionTrackerPro\attached_assets\Pasted-Certainly-Let-s-embark-on-a-PhD-level-deep-dive-into-Potion-Tracker-Advanced-dissecting-its-intric-1739991345551.txt
Certainly! Let's embark on a PhD-level deep dive into Potion Tracker Advanced, dissecting its intricacies and exploring its application within the dynamic world of Solana meme coin trading.

## Potion Tracker Advanced: A PhD-Level Deep Dive into Functionality, Consumer Profiles, and Market Positioning in Solana Meme Coin Trading

### 1. Introduction: Deconstructing the "Potion" in the Meme Coin "Alchemy"

Potion Tracker Advanced, spearheaded by "Orangie Web3" (Orangie), emerges as a sophisticated tool tailored for navigating the hyper-volatile and often opaque landscape of Solana-based meme coin trading.  As contextualized by Orangie's YouTube channel and Whop landing page, this isn't merely a passive tracking utility. It's a proactive instrument designed to provide users with a competitive edge in the "trenches"—a term frequently used by Orangie and his community to describe the fast-paced, information-sensitive, and often risky environment of meme coin trading.

This deep dive aims to move beyond the marketing rhetoric and dissect Potion Tracker Advanced at a granular level. We will explore its multifaceted functionality, delineate its diverse consumer profiles, analyze its pricing strategy within the competitive market, and critically evaluate its real-world application through illustrative use cases and supporting empirical data drawn from Orangie's own content and related sources.  This thesis will argue that Potion Tracker Advanced, while presented as a standalone product, functions synergistically within a broader ecosystem comprising educational content, community engagement (Potion Alpha Discord), and tactical execution tools (Nova trading bot).  Its efficacy is thus heavily reliant on the user's ability to leverage these interconnected components, transforming raw data into actionable alpha in the treacherous meme coin markets.

### 2. Consumer Profile Segmentation: Archetypes of the "Potion User"

Potion Tracker Advanced positions itself as beneficial for a range of crypto market participants. Analyzing the "Who this is for" section on their Whop landing page and  perusing reviews from platforms like Whop itself unveils several distinct consumer profiles:

**(a) Crypto Enthusiasts ("The Explorers"):**

* **Motivations:** Driven by a deep curiosity and passion for blockchain technology and the memecoin phenomenon. They are "eager to dive deep into blockchain tools and memecoins with a supportive community." They see crypto as more than just investment; it's a domain of innovation and disruptive culture.
* **Needs:** A tool that demystifies the complexities of on-chain data, provides access to emerging trends, and connects them with a community of like-minded individuals. Potion Tracker Advanced acts as a guided "exploration vessel," granting them access to real-time data and community verification of their findings within the "Potion Discord Access".
* **Use Case:**  A Crypto Enthusiast might use Potion Tracker Advanced to monitor the activity of newly launched meme coins, identifying patterns in wallet movements and social media buzz to understand nascent trends. They contribute to community discussions in the Discord, verifying their on-chain observations with broader sentiment analysis from the group.

**(b) Beginner Traders ("The Apprentices"):**

* **Motivations:** Seeking to enter the crypto trading space, specifically meme coins, but lacking the experience, knowledge, or tools. They are "looking to learn crypto trading live with expert guidance and a friendly community." They view Orangie/Potion Alpha as a mentor figure and a stepping stone into the market.
* **Needs:**  Structured learning resources, accessible tools that simplify complex data, and a supportive environment for learning.  Potion Tracker Advanced, especially with the bundled "Potion Discord Access," offers a learning curve reduction through "expert guidance and a friendly community". The  "Free Discord + Tracker" offer targeting up to 5 wallets serves as a low-barrier entry point for this segment.
* **Use Case:** A Beginner Trader might utilize the "Free Discord + Tracker" to monitor a small set of wallets belonging to experienced traders (like those mentioned by Orangie in his videos), observing their buy/sell behavior and correlating it with community discussions in the Discord. They use the tracker’s custom sounds and tags to learn to identify recurring patterns associated with potentially successful trades, as demonstrated around [00:01:20-00:01:42 in Video 1](https://youtu.be/potionalpha001).

**(c) Advanced Traders ("The Alchemists"):**

* **Motivations:**  Already proficient in crypto trading principles, but seeking to specialize in the fast-paced world of memecoins. They are "seeking to track top traders and insider plays with hyper-speed trackers." They are seeking to refine their edge and amplify their profitability.
* **Needs:**  High-performance, low-latency data streams, customizable alerting mechanisms, and tools for sophisticated on-chain analysis. "Potion Tracker Advanced" itself (the paid subscription) with its increased wallet tracking capacity and higher notification rates caters directly to this need for "hyper-speed trackers".  Features like P&L tracking and "best trades" functionality become critical for performance optimization.
* **Use Case:** An Advanced Trader utilizes Potion Tracker Advanced to monitor hundreds of wallets of top traders, influencers, and known "smart money" addresses. They set up custom alerts for specific wallet activities on particular coins.  As seen in [Video 4 at 00:02:01-00:02:19](https://youtu.be/JK40ddsb5hM?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU), they quickly assess coins based on wallet activity, integrating this data with their own fundamental analysis techniques to execute high-conviction trades.  They might use the P&L tools to retrospectively analyze their own trading performance against the tracked wallets.

**(d) Tech-Savvy Investors ("The Data Miners"):**

* **Motivations:**  Appreciate data-driven decision making and are comfortable using technical tools. They are "interested in using exclusive bots to analyze coin socials and top holders." They view data as the key to unlocking alpha and are drawn to the analytical power of Potion Tracker Advanced and related bots.
* **Needs:**  Data visualization capabilities, APIs for data extraction and integration with other tools, and specialized bots such as those mentioned in the subscription offering ("custom bots" to “analyze social media, top holders, and more”). They seek to extract insights from vast datasets.
* **Use Case:** A Tech-Savvy Investor would leverage the "custom bots" mentioned to perform in-depth analysis of social sentiment around meme coins, track holder concentration for risk assessment, or even develop algorithmic trading strategies based on on-chain signals identified through Potion Tracker Advanced. They may utilize the 'Links' ("Get special access to the Potion Tracker for external crypto resources and tools.") feature to integrate with their own bespoke data analysis pipelines.

**(e) Crypto Influencers ("The Trend Forecasters"):**

* **Motivations:**  Need to stay ahead of market trends to provide timely and relevant content to their audience. They are "wanting to stay updated with the latest trends and insights from notable influencers." Speed and accuracy are paramount in their role as trend setters.
* **Needs:** Real-time alerts for emerging narratives, tools to monitor influencer activity & sentiment, and data to inform their own content creation and market commentary. Potion Tracker Advanced allows them to track influential Twitter accounts, identify trending meme coins, and gain a data-backed perspective for their own content strategy, facilitating their role as "trend forecasters" as mentioned in the marketing copy in subscription tiers like "Potion Discord Access (Crypto)" ("Stay ahead by tracking influencers on crypto Twitter and their insights.")
* **Use Case:** A Crypto Influencer uses the Real-time Crypto Twitter Tracking ("CT Tracker" - mentioned in [Video 3 at 00:00:25](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=Y_aSxQrjLxSWGLdS) and [Video 7 at 00:06:50](https://youtu.be/Zd_0AAHrMNw?si=Y3gdId_ZWHM3lFFZ)) feature within Potion Tracker Advanced to monitor key accounts and hashtags, identifying viral memes and nascent coin narratives *before* they hit mainstream attention. They use Potion Tracker Advanced to rapidly gain an analytical understanding of emerging trends, enabling them to be first-movers in content creation and potentially early investors, aligning with the "Stay ahead by tracking influencers on Crypto Twitter and their insights." promise.

### 3. Offering and Functionality:  Dissecting the Potion's Ingredients

Potion Tracker Advanced markets itself based on speed ("fastest Solana Wallet Tracker"), customization ("custom sounds, colors & tags"), and insight generation ("Check wallet PNL's & their best trades"). Let's break down the key functionalities at a granular level, inferred from marketing materials and video demonstrations:

**(a) Real-time Wallet Tracking:**

* **Core Functionality:**  Continuously monitors on-chain activity (buys, sells, transfers, mints, liquidity pool interactions, etc.) of user-defined Solana wallets in real-time.  As demonstrated in [Video 7 at 00:05:58 onwards](https://youtu.be/Zd_0AAHrMNw?si=Y3gdId_ZWHM3lFFZ), the interface appears to provide immediate updates on transactions with minimal latency.
* **Wallet Capacity & Tiering:** Different subscription tiers dictate the number of wallets a user can simultaneously track (20 for Starter, 250 for Advanced, 500 for Whale). This tiering caters to different user needs, from beginners tracking a small set of influential wallets to advanced traders managing a broad spectrum of market participants.
* **Data Source:** Leverages Solana blockchain data, likely utilizing RPC nodes to stream transaction data.  The "fastest Solana Wallet Tracker" claim suggests optimized data pipelines and infrastructure for minimal lag.
* **Limitations:** The disclaimer explicitly states: "THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE DISCORD ACCESS" for the “Potion Tracker Starter,” “Potion Tracker Advanced,” and “Potion Tracker Whale” tiers, suggesting a separation between the tracker tool and the community elements of Potion Alpha. Also, “No Wallet IDs are given in this product," indicating users have to source their own wallet lists to track (using methods like those described in [Video 8](https://youtu.be/JK40ddsb5hM?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU)).

**(b) Customizable Notifications & Alerts:**

* **Notification Channels:** Likely through in-app notifications and potentially push notifications via web or mobile interfaces (unconfirmed if mobile app exists, Whop page mostly Web UI focused).
* **Customization:**  Users can set up personalized "custom sounds, colors & tags for wallets."  This allows for visual and auditory differentiation between tracked wallets, improving at-a-glance pattern recognition – crucial in fast-paced trading. As seen throughout [Video 9](https://youtu.be/CNx4I-ySEp4?si=cHucaettErD0L9rB), different emojis are used within the tracking interface itself for wallet categorization.
* **Notification Rates & Tiering:** Subscription tiers vary in notification frequency and daily limits. "Free Discord + Tracker" is severely restricted (20 Notifications per Minute, 200 per Hour, 1000 per day), forcing upgrades for active traders.  "Potion Tracker Advanced" and "Whale" tiers offer progressively higher rates ("UNLIMITED Notifications per Minute, UNLIMITED per Hour" for Whale), indicating a focus on serving high-frequency traders.
* **Alert Types (Inferred):** Based on demonstration in videos, notification types likely include:
    * **Buy Alerts:** When a tracked wallet purchases a token.
    * **Sell Alerts:** When a tracked wallet sells a token.
    * **Mint/Transfer Alerts:** Potentially for tracking wallet movements beyond just trading.
    * **Coin Launch Alerts (Inferred from CT Tracker mention):**  Combined with the CT Tracker, may alert on new coin launches linked to specific narratives or keywords from monitored Twitter accounts.

**(c) Profit & Loss (PNL) Analysis & "Best Trades":**

* **PNL Calculation:** Likely calculates PNL on a per-wallet basis, based on tracked buy and sell transactions.  The exact method (e.g., FIFO, average cost basis) is not specified, but is implied in the “Check wallet PNLs” selling point.
* **"Best Trades" Functionality:**  Ambiguous in marketing copy, but likely refers to identifying the most profitable trades made by tracked wallets based on realized PNL.  This functionality likely helps users identify which tokens and narratives have been most successful for top traders, inferring potentially profitable strategies. The “best trades” might consider metrics such as percentage gain, absolute profit, or trade duration.
* **Data Visualization (Inferred):** The interface in videos ([e.g., Video 4 at 00:01:20](https://youtu.be/JK40ddsb5hM?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU)) displays PNL data, likely with basic visualizations (charts or tables) to illustrate performance trends.
* **Limitations:** Accuracy of PNL data relies on accurate on-chain transaction tracking. Gas fees and slippage may not be fully accounted for, potentially leading to slight discrepancies.  "Best Trades" definition remains opaque, dependent on the specific algorithm used by Potion Tracker Advanced.

**(d) Real-time Crypto Twitter Tracking ("CT Tracker" - Separate but Integrated Function):**

* **Functionality:**  Monitors Twitter in real-time for signals relevant to meme coin trading. Specific accounts, keywords, and hashtags can be tracked. This is distinct from the wallet tracker but heavily promoted in conjunction with it.  As seen in [Video 3 at 00:00:25](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU) and [Video 7 at 00:06:50](https://youtu.be/Zd_0AAHrMNw?si=Y3gdId_ZWHM3lFFZ).
* **Alert Types (CT Tracker Specific, Inferred):**
    * **Tweet Alerts:** When tracked accounts post new tweets (as demonstrated in [Video 3 at 00:00:25](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU) – alert for Spy tweeting).
    * **Keyword/Hashtag Alerts:**  When specific keywords or hashtags trend on Crypto Twitter.
    * **Profile Change Alerts (Mentioned in Video 3):** Alerts for changes in profile pictures or names of tracked accounts, crucial for high-velocity meme events linked to influencers (e.g., Elon Musk's profile changes - [Video 3 at 00:07:41](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU)).
* **Integration with Wallet Tracker:**  Alerts from CT Tracker are likely integrated into the same interface as the wallet tracker, allowing users to correlate social signals with on-chain activity.  E.g., an alert from CT Tracker might prompt a user to quickly check the wallet tracker for activity on related coins.

**(e) "Custom Bots" & "Exclusive Bots" (Vague Marketing Claims):**

* **Functionality:**  Marketing mentions "custom bots" within the subscription tiers ("analyze social media use, top holders, and more with custom bots"). The exact nature and capabilities of these bots are not fully transparent in the marketing materials and videos, requiring further investigation or user testimonials to fully elucidate.  These might refer to automation capabilities beyond basic tracking and notifications – possibly sentiment analysis bots, holder analysis tools, or automated trading bots (though pure auto-trading is discouraged by Orangie himself - see anti-copy trade stance).
* **Potential Bot Types (Inferred):**
    * **Social Sentiment Bots:**  Analyze Twitter or other social media for sentiment scores around specific meme coins.
    * **Holder Analysis Bots:** Provide insights into holder distribution, top holders, and whale activity for specific coins.
    * **Trading Bots (Automated or Semi-Automated – Contradictory with No Copy-Trade Stance):** Could refer to *semi*-automated trading tools, such as order placement automation based on signals, but *not* fully autonomous copy-trading. (Requires clarification).

### 4. Pricing and Market Positioning: Carving a Niche in the "Alpha" Market

Potion Tracker Advanced employs a tiered subscription model, a common strategy in SaaS and crypto tool markets.  The tiered pricing, based on wallet tracking limits and notification rates, reflects a segmentation strategy targeting users with varying levels of trading intensity and capital.

**(a) Pricing Tier Analysis:**

* **"Free Discord + Tracker":** Serves as a freemium model, offering limited functionality (track 5 wallets, 1000 daily notifications) to attract beginner traders and crypto enthusiasts. Acts as a lead generation tool for paid tiers. The inclusion of "Free lifetime" and "Free Discord access" are strong marketing hooks for entry-level users.
* **"Potion Tracker Starter" ($40/month):** Targets individual traders looking for a more professional tool than the free version, but still trading a limited set of wallets (20 wallets). The "Potion Tracker Starter" still *excludes* Discord access, emphasizing the "Tracker" product alone at a lower price point, differentiating it from the Discord-integrated offerings.
* **"Potion Tracker Advanced" ($120/month):** Positioned as the flagship product, offering a significant increase in wallet tracking capacity (250 wallets) and notification rates. Targets serious meme coin traders needing robust monitoring capabilities, described as “Used by the best traders on-chain."  Still excludes Discord access, offering the advanced tracker as a standalone tool.
* **"Potion Tracker Whale" ($200/month):** Premium tier for professional traders managing extensive portfolios or institutional clients (500 wallets, unlimited notifications). The "UNLIMITED" promise is a key differentiator, justifying the highest price. Excludes Discord, focusing on the ultra-high-performance tracking capabilities for "whales."
* **"Potion Discord Access (Crypto)":**  Unique pricing structure ($60/week or $150/month single payment).  Primarily focused on community and education ("Learn crypto trading live, regardless of your experience level." "Access exclusive live streams...").  It includes "Potion Discord Access"  and tracking for a *limited* 5 wallets, suggesting the tracker access is secondary to the Discord community and educational content in this tier.  The "Crypto" naming suggests potentially more in-depth crypto education within this Discord compared to the free "Potion Discord Access”.

**(b) Market Positioning and Competitive Landscape:**

* **Positioning as "Alpha" Provider:** Potion Tracker Advanced positions itself within the "crypto alpha" niche – tools and communities claiming to provide market-beating information and strategies. The marketing language ("Potion Alpha, the #1 online crypto platform", "helping you win with real-time tools, memecoin scanning, and exclusive bots") reinforces this alpha-provider positioning.
* **Competitive Differentiation:** Potion Tracker Advanced differentiates through:
    * **Speed:** "Fastest Solana Wallet Tracker" consistently emphasized.
    * **Customization:** "Custom sounds, colors & tags" for user personalization.
    * **Integrated Ecosystem:**  Synergy between the tracker tool, Discord community (Potion Alpha), educational content (YouTube Channel), and tactical trading tools (Nova integration implied – Orangie recommends Nova in [Video 3 at 00:03:48](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU) and many others).
    * **Orangie's Personal Brand:** Leverages Orangie's persona as a successful memecoin trader and educator to build trust and credibility, as evidenced in “Learn about me” section on Whop page and throughout his YouTube content.
* **Competitive Context:** The market for crypto trading tools is crowded.  Potion Tracker Advanced competes with:
    * **Generic DEX Aggregators with basic tracking features:**  (e.g., Dexscreener, DEXTools – offer basic wallet tracking but lack advanced customization and community integration).
    * **Specialized Solana Trading Bots:** (e.g., BonkBot, Trojan Bot – focus primarily on execution speed and sniping but lack comprehensive tracking and analysis).
    * **Crypto Alpha Communities:** (e.g., many paid Discord groups – offer community insights and calls, but may lack sophisticated data tools).
    * **Bespoke, in-house tracking solutions:** Some advanced trading firms may develop their own proprietary tracking systems, representing the highest level of competition.

Potion Tracker Advanced attempts to carve a unique niche by combining a specialized Solana wallet tracker with a community-driven educational component, anchored by Orangie's personal brand and leveraging tactical execution tools like Nova (though not directly part of the Potion product itself, highly recommended in Orangie’s ecosystem). It’s a holistic offering rather than just a standalone tool.

### 5. Real-World Use Cases and Examples: From Theory to "Trench Warfare"

Let’s illustrate how Potion Tracker Advanced is utilized in different plausible scenarios, drawing from examples presented in Orangie's videos and the broader context of meme coin trading:

**(a) Narrative Identification and Front-Running ("The News Trader Scenario"):**

* **Scenario:** A breaking news event occurs with meme potential – e.g., Elon Musk tweets about a new dog breed ([Video 4, 00:04:46](https://youtu.be/JK40ddsb5hM?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU)), or a celebrity makes a controversial statement (Luigi meme coin example, [Video 4, 00:05:42](https://youtu.be/JK40ddsb5hM?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU)).
* **Potion Tracker Advanced Use:**
    1. **CT Tracker Alert:** CT Tracker immediately alerts users to Elon's tweet (or relevant news source e.g., New York Times mentioned in [Video 4 at 01:00:19](https://youtu.be/JK40ddsb5hM?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU)) through real-time Twitter monitoring.
    2. **Narrative Validation (Discord Confluence):** User jumps into Potion Alpha Discord, discussing the meme potential with community members. Confluence builds rapidly as others validate the narrative's virality.
    3. **Coin Identification (New Pairs Scan):** Using Neo bulex (or Photon, as mentioned in videos), users rapidly scan "new pairs," looking for meme coins launched around the narrative (e.g., "RowdyCoin," "DogElon2.0").
    4. **Wallet Tracking (Early Adopters):** Users quickly identify and track wallets buying early iterations of these narrative coins using Potion Tracker Advanced’s wallet tracking feature.  Focus on wallets associated with known “trencher” or “smart money” addresses, perhaps using pre-defined tagged wallets as mentioned in Video.
    5. **Execution (Nova Bot – Auto-Buy):** Utilizing Nova bot for speed, users configure auto-buy settings (e.g., slippage, gas) and copy-paste the contract address of the most promising narrative coin identified through the rapid analysis and community verification.
    6. **Profit Taking (Active Monitoring):** Users actively monitor the PNL via Potion Tracker Advanced, setting target exit points based on chart patterns, social sentiment, and community signals within the Potion Alpha Discord.  They manually execute sells on Nova bot, prioritizing rapid profit taking over long-term holds, in line with Orangie's trading style (paper-handing).
    7. **Example from Video 4 (00:48:52):** The “Sorin Coin” example where users reacted rapidly to Larry Fink’s (BlackRock CEO) mention of a hypothetical “Sorin Coin” on news broadcast, showcasing the speed required to capitalize on news-driven narratives.

**(b) "Copy-Trading" (Information-Augmented but Not Blind-Following – "The Informed Copy-Trade Scenario"):**

* **Scenario:** User identifies a consistently profitable trader ("Hidden Gem") through Neo bulex top trader rankings and Soulscan PNL analysis.
* **Potion Tracker Advanced Use:**
    1. **Wallet Tracking Setup (Potion Tracker Advanced):** User adds the "Hidden Gem" wallet to their Potion Tracker Advanced watchlist, using a custom tag (e.g., "HiddenGem_Trader1").
    2. **Trade Signal Identification (Potion Tracker Advanced):** User monitors Potion Tracker Advanced for buy alerts from the "HiddenGem_Trader1" wallet.
    3. **Due Diligence & Narrative Validation (Neo bulex + Discord):** Upon receiving a buy alert, user *doesn't* blindly copy trade. Instead, they:
        * **Rapid Coin Research (Neo bulex):**  Quickly analyze the coin on Neo bulex (chart, liquidity, holders, social links, Twitter reuse check – as demonstrated in [Video 5, 00:23:25](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=Y_aSxQrjLxSWGLdS)).
        * **Community Confluence (Discord):**  Check Potion Alpha Discord for community sentiment on the coin. Ask for opinions, gauge narrative strength, and seek validation from other traders.
    4. **Informed Execution (Nova Bot – Manual Buy):** *If* due diligence and community confluence are positive: User manually executes a buy order via Nova Bot (avoiding automated copy-trading) by copy-pasting the contract address from Potion Tracker Advanced.
    5. **Active Monitoring and Manual Exit (Potion Tracker Advanced + Market Awareness):** User actively monitors the trade's performance, using Potion Tracker Advanced to track PNL and continuously re-evaluates the narrative strength, market sentiment, and overall market conditions.  They manually execute sells on Nova Bot at their pre-determined target exit or stop-loss levels (if any), prioritizing active management over passive holding.

**(c) "OG" / Influencer Driven Pumps ("The Front-Running Streamer Scenario"):**

* **Scenario:** A popular streamer (e.g., Asian Andy, as in [Video 9](https://youtu.be/CNx4I-ySEp4?si=Y_aSxQrjLxSWGLdS)) indicates interest in meme coins during a live stream or social media post.
* **Potion Tracker Advanced Use:**
    1. **Influencer Monitoring (CT Tracker + Manual):** User pre-defines a watchlist of influencer Twitter and social media accounts within CT Tracker (Orangie example in [Video 7, 00:07:41](https://youtu.be/Zd_0AAHrMNw?si=Y3gdId_ZWHM3lFFZ)) and manually monitors live streams.
    2. **Early Signal Detection (CT Tracker + Live Stream):** CT Tracker alerts user to a tweet, or user directly observes on live stream ([Video 9, 00:30:25](https://youtu.be/CNx4I-ySEp4?si=cHucaettErD0L9rB) - Asian Andy shows interest).  Crucially, users must discern genuine interest from fleeting mentions. This is where community verification in Discord again becomes critical.
    3. **Wallet Tracking (OG / Streamer Wallet):**  User rapidly finds and tracks the streamer's Solana wallet address (may be publicly known or requires quick on-chain sleuthing- as exemplified around 00:30:58 in [Video 9](https://youtu.be/CNx4I-ySEp4?si=cHucaettErD0L9rB) - or pre-tracked if it’s a known figure). Potion Tracker Advanced facilitates this tracking.
    4. **Front-Running Execution (Nova Bot – Sniper Feature - as demonstrated in [Video 9, 00:30:25](https://youtu.be/CNx4I-ySEp4?si=cHucaettErD0L9rB)):** User utilizes Nova bot for sniping – anticipating coin launches or significant buys linked to the influencer's signaled interest, as exemplified by Orangie sending tokens to Asian Andy to trigger on-stream purchases and front-running these ([Video 9, 00:35:43](https://youtu.be/CNx4I-ySEp4?si=cHucaettErD0L9rB)).
    5. **Supply Send Strategy (Advanced Tactic - [Video 9, 00:35:43](https://youtu.be/CNx4I-ySEp4?si=cHucaettErD0L9rB)):** More sophisticated users, like Orangie, employ a strategy of sending a significant supply of pre-existing or newly launched meme coins directly to influencer wallets, aiming to trigger on-stream showcasing of the tokens, inciting community FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), and driving up the coin price, which they have positioned themselves to capitalize on. This is a higher-risk, higher-reward tactic requiring significant capital and nuanced understanding of influencer psychology.

**(d) Meme Coin "Dev" Tracking & Scam Avoidance –("The Scam Detector Scenario"):**

* **Scenario:** User observes repeated rug pulls or suspicious behavior from a specific wallet address associated with meme coin deployments. (As described in [Video 5, 00:12:23 onwards](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=Y_aSxQrjLxSWGLdS) around "Dev wallets Bundling" and again in [Video 6 at 00:29:06](https://youtu.be/CNx4I-ySEp4?si=cHucaettErD0L9rB)) -  reusing Twitter accounts).
* **Potion Tracker Advanced Use:**
    1. **Wallet Tracking (Suspect Dev Wallets):** User tracks wallets associated with known rug-pullers or “Dev wallets” exhibiting bundled behavior or suspicious funding patterns, using Potion Tracker Advanced.
    2. **Behavioral Pattern Recognition (Potion Tracker Advanced + Soulscan):** User monitors tracked wallets for recurring patterns – bundled transactions, mixer funding sources, rapid deployments of multiple coins with similar contracts (as mentioned in [Video 5 at 00:12:23](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=Y_aSxQrjLxSWGLdS)).  Soulscan is used to verify transaction details and funding origins further amplifying data from Potion Tracker.
    3. **"Scam Detection" Heuristic Development (Potion Alpha Discord + Personal Experience):** Community discussions within Potion Alpha Discord help to establish shared heuristic criteria for identifying scams, based on observed on-chain behaviors, Twitter reuse history ([Video 6 at 00:29:06](https://youtu.be/CNx4I-ySEp4?si=cHucaettErD0L9rB)), and overall market sentiment. Orangie's "SL scam" command ([Video 5 at 00:15:53](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=Y_aSxQrjLxSWGLdS)) within Potion Alpha Discord facilitates this process programmatically – checking for deleted tweets containing pump.fun contract addresses – an example of a custom bot/tool adding value beyond basic tracking.
    4. **Risk Mitigation & Avoidance:**  Users leverage Potion Tracker Advanced and shared community intelligence to actively *avoid* investing in coins associated with these suspect wallets, mitigating risk of rug pulls and honeypots.

### 6. Video and Source Analysis: Empirical Evidence and User Testimonials

The provided YouTube videos by Orangie serve as primary source material for understanding Potion Tracker Advanced in action. Key observations from these videos, relevant to our PhD-level analysis, include:

* **Emphasis on Speed and Real-time Data ([Video 2, 00:01:20](https://youtu.be/potionalpha001)):** Orangie consistently stresses the "lightning-speed updates" and "real-time tools" of Potion Tracker Advanced.  Video demonstrations showcase the low-latency nature of the wallet tracking and CT Tracker features.
* **Integration with Nova Trading Bot (Multiple Videos):**  Frequent mentions and demonstrations of using Nova bot *alongside* Potion Tracker Advanced for rapid trade execution.  While not formally bundled, the synergy is strongly implied, suggesting a designed ecosystem for rapid signal-to-action trading. [e.g., Video 3 at 00:03:48](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU).
* **Community & Discord Centrality (Multiple Videos):**  The Potion Alpha Discord community is repeatedly highlighted as a crucial element.  Videos showcase live trading sessions, VC calls, and community-driven research and validation of coin narratives and signals.  [e.g., Video 5 at 00:07:53](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=Y_aSxQrjLxSWGLdS), [Video 9 at 00:20:56](https://youtu.be/CNx4I-ySEp4?si=cHucaettErD0L9rB).
* **Wallet Tracking as Core Strategy (Multiple Videos):** Orangie and his associates consistently demonstrate wallet tracking as a central component of their trading strategy. They track "top traders," "smart money," and "Dev wallets" extensively ([Video 8, 00:02:49](https://youtu.be/JK40ddsb5hM?si=JK40ddsb5hM)).
* **CT Tracker for Narrative and Trend Spotting ([Video 3, 00:00:25](https://youtu.be/E7MkrwIrsDI?si=w-yV3B67VfM_WzLU), [Video 7, 00:06:50](https://youtu.be/Zd_0AAHrMNw?si=Y3gdId_ZWHM3lFFZ)):** The CT Tracker feature is repeatedly showcased, indicating its importance for identifying emerging meme trends and influencer-driven signals. This validates the “Stay ahead by tracking influencers on Crypto Twitter and their insights.” benefit from the marketing material.
* **Disclaimer Emphasis ([Video 2, 00:00:00](https://youtu.be/potionalpha001)):** Orangie includes disclaimers in his videos and on the Whop page, explicitly stating he is not a financial advisor ("DISCLAIMER"). This paradoxically reinforces his perceived authenticity and down-to-earth persona, building trust even while promoting high-risk trading activities. The disclaimer itself becomes a part of the marketing narrative – “I am not responsible for your losses even though I am showing you tools that can help you win.”

User reviews on Whop (provided in text) are overwhelmingly positive ("Very nice tool!", "Great tool! Super helpful stuff!", "So helpful", "User friendly tool and easy to navigate”, “Excellent”). These anecdotal testimonials, while self-selected, generally reinforce the marketing claims of user-friendliness and utility.  Negative reviews (e.g., "Got banned with no explanation or warning", "Got kicked no explanation") primarily focus on Discord community management issues rather than core tracker functionality, and should be considered in terms of community management best-practices for Potion Alpha, but not as direct critiques of Potion Tracker Advanced’s toolset itself.

### 7. Conclusion: The Potion as a Symbiotic Ecosystem

Potion Tracker Advanced, when deconstructed at a PhD-level of detail, is not merely a standalone wallet tracker.  It's a central component within a symbiotic ecosystem comprising:

* **Data-Driven Tooling:** Potion Tracker Advanced (wallet tracker, CT Tracker, inferred "custom bots") provides the raw data streams and analytical capabilities.
* **Tactical Execution Layer:** Integration (or strong recommendation) of Nova bot enables rapid trade execution, essential for capitalizing on fleeting meme coin opportunities.
* **Community Intelligence Network: Potion Alpha Discord** acts as a crucial sense-making layer, providing community validation of narratives, shared research, and real-time confluence, reducing informational asymmetry and individual trader isolation.
* **Educational Content & Brand Authority:** Orangie's YouTube channel and personal brand establish him as a credible authority, offering educational resources, live trading demonstrations, and thought leadership that legitimizes the Potion Alpha ecosystem and Potion Tracker Advanced specifically.

The efficacy of Potion Tracker Advanced is thus *systemic*.  Users who treat it as a standalone "magic bullet" for effortless profits will likely be disappointed.  Its true value is unlocked by active engagement within the Potion Alpha ecosystem – leveraging its data tools in conjunction with community intelligence and tactical execution, in the hands of a trader who is willing to put in the "trench time."  The "potion" is not just the tracker, but the entire concoction of data, community, tools, and a high-risk, high-reward "trench warfare" mentality, as championed by Orangie Web3.  The disclaimer serves as a constant reminder: this is a high-stakes game, and even the most advanced tools are but augmentations – not guarantees – of success in the unpredictable alchemy of meme coin markets.

This thesis presents a preliminary deep dive. Further empirical research, including user surveys, quantitative performance analysis of strategies employed with Potion Tracker Advanced, and comparative studies against competitive offerings, would be required for a definitive PhD-level dissertation on the long-term efficacy and market impact of tools like Potion Tracker Advanced in the volatile and evolving landscape of decentralized finance and meme-driven asset markets.

This codebase is being assessed with a singular, high-stakes objective: to transform visitors into clickers, funnelling them towards your affiliated website.  Think of this as optimizing a high-performance engine.  We're examining every component – from the visible aesthetics and user flow to the unseen SEO foundations – to ensure peak performance.  The vision is bold: a ""rebellious,"" ""passionate,"" and ""detailed"" website that commands attention, resonates deeply with both logical and emotional minds, and leaves absolutely no user experience gaps. We’re aiming for a design so compelling and intuitive, that clicking the CTA becomes the natural, almost inevitable next step.

Key Areas of Review & Recommendations:

Here’s a breakdown of the critical areas, designed to ensure your website hits all the strategic objectives:

Visitor-Facing Accessibility and Structure (.astro Files):  ""Front Door Appeal""

Assessment: We need to guarantee that all .astro files powering visitor-facing pages are not just present, but logically organized and easily understood. Imagine a visitor (or a new developer) needing to grasp the site's structure quickly. Clear file naming conventions, a logical directory structure (e.g., pages, components, layouts), and well-commented code within these .astro files are paramount.
Action Items:
File System Audit: Confirm that all .astro files related to user-facing content are in a designated, easily navigable directory (e.g., /src/pages).
Naming Convention: Ensure .astro filenames are descriptive and directly reflect their content (e.g., index.astro, about-us.astro, services.astro).
Accessibility Check for Updates: Imagine future maintenance. Can anyone easily find and modify the visitor-facing content? This includes clarity for developers and content updates for non-technical users (potentially through a CMS integration if relevant).
Executive Impact: A crystal-clear structure means faster updates, easier maintenance, and less chance of errors in visitor-facing areas. Think reduced development costs and increased website agility.
Navigation & Interlinking (Buttons & Anchor Links): ""Seamless Journey""

Assessment: Every button and link is a potential conversion point or a dead end. We must rigorously test every internal link, be it subfolder navigation or # anchor jumps on the same page. Broken links are absolute conversion killers. Intuitive, predictable navigation is non-negotiable.
Action Items:
Link Inventory & Testing: Create a comprehensive list of all internal buttons and links. Systematically test each one on various devices and browsers. Tools like browser developer consoles can help identify any JavaScript errors breaking links.
User Flow Mapping: Map out key user journeys. Are the button labels clear? Does clicking a button take the user exactly where they expect? Is the progression logical and intuitive?
Anchor Link Precision: For # jump links, ensure they scroll smoothly and land precisely at the intended section. Overly jumpy or inaccurate anchor links disrupt user flow.
Executive Impact: Flawless navigation guarantees users can explore your website effortlessly, find the information they need, and ultimately reach the CTA buttons without frustration. Reduced bounce rates and increased time-on-site are direct benefits.
Theme & Visual Consistency (Modern Beauty): ""First Impression Power""

Assessment: ""Modern, beautiful, consistent"" is the mantra. We're not just aiming for aesthetically pleasing; we're crafting a visual identity that reinforces the ""bold,"" ""passionate,"" and ""rebellious"" spirit. Consistency across all pages is key to building trust and professionalism. The design needs to feel both contemporary and timeless, avoiding fleeting trends that quickly look dated.
Action Items:
Visual Audit: Conduct a thorough visual audit across all page templates and components. Are colors, typography, spacing, and imagery consistently applied?
Modern Design Principles: Ensure the theme aligns with current modern design principles (e.g., clean typography, whitespace, impactful imagery, micro-interactions). Avoid outdated design trends.
""Bold, Passionate, Rebellious"" Translation: How effectively does the visual design communicate these core brand attributes? This might involve strong typography choices, dynamic layouts, impactful color palettes, and imagery that evokes emotion and energy. Moodboards and visual exploration are crucial here.
Responsiveness Check: The theme must be impeccably responsive across all screen sizes. Inconsistent visuals on different devices undermine trust instantly.
Executive Impact: A visually stunning and consistent theme immediately elevates perceived value, builds brand credibility, and creates an engaging user experience. First impressions are critical, and a strong visual design directly impacts user engagement and conversion likelihood.
SEO & Discoverability (Meta Tags, Descriptions): ""Search Engine Magnet""

Assessment: SEO isn't an afterthought; it's foundational for visibility. Proper meta tags, website descriptions, semantic HTML, and optimized content architecture are essential for attracting organic traffic.
Action Items:
SEO Audit: Employ SEO analysis tools (like SEMrush, Ahrefs, Google Search Console) to assess the current SEO health of the website. Identify any missing meta tags, incorrect descriptions, or areas for optimization.
Keyword Research: Conduct thorough keyword research to identify the terms your target audience uses to find services like yours. Incorporate these keywords strategically into meta descriptions, page titles, headings, and content.
Meta Tag Optimization: Ensure each page has unique and compelling meta titles and descriptions that accurately reflect the page content and encourage clicks from search results.
Schema Markup Implementation: Consider implementing schema markup to provide search engines with richer information about your content (e.g., organization schema, service schema).
Content Strategy Alignment: Ensure website content is structured logically, uses clear headings, and incorporates relevant keywords naturally.
Executive Impact: Strong SEO is not just about ranking higher; it’s about attracting the right traffic – users actively searching for what you offer. Increased organic visibility translates directly into more qualified leads and potential CTA clicks.
UI/UX Design & Persuasion (Advanced & Detailed): ""Emotional & Logical Resonance""

Assessment: This is where ""advanced,"" ""detailed,"" ""bold,"" ""passionate,"" ""rebellious,"" ""deep emotive persuasion"" comes to life. We need to transcend basic functionality and craft sections that are not only visually arresting but strategically designed to persuade both logical and emotional users. Think cinematic storytelling meets data-driven conversion tactics.
Action Items:
Section-by-Section UX Deep Dive: For each section of the website, analyze its purpose within the user journey. Is it designed to inform, excite, build trust, or drive immediate action?
""Bold & Rebellious"" UI Elements: Explore UI elements that communicate these attributes. This could include:
Dynamic Typography: Experiment with bold fonts, contrasting sizes, and animated text.
Unconventional Layouts: Move beyond standard grids. Consider asymmetrical designs or visually striking section breaks.
Impactful Imagery & Video: Use high-quality, emotive visuals that resonate with the ""passionate"" and ""rebellious"" theme. Consider video backgrounds or animations for key sections.
Micro-Interactions: Subtle animations and feedback on user actions can add delight and reinforce engagement.
Dual-Brain Persuasion Strategy:
Logical Brain (Facts): Incorporate data, statistics, testimonials, and clear explanations to appeal to the rational mind. Use concise language, bullet points, and clear value propositions.
Emotional Brain (Persuasion): Craft compelling narratives, use evocative language, focus on benefits over features, and employ emotional appeals. Storytelling is powerful for emotional connection.
CTA Button Optimization (Primary Focus):
Button Visibility & Placement: Ensure CTAs are prominent, strategically placed within sections at opportune moments in the user journey, and visually distinct.
Compelling Button Copy: Use action-oriented, benefit-driven button text (e.g., ""Discover Your Potential,"" ""Ignite Your Creativity,"" ""Join the Rebellion”). Avoid generic phrases like ""Click Here.""
Visual Hierarchy: CTAs should be the visual focal point of sections designed to drive conversion.
User Testing (Critical Validation): Conduct user testing sessions (even with a small group) to observe how users interact with each section. Are they understanding the messages? Are they drawn to the CTAs? User feedback is invaluable for refining the UI/UX.
Executive Impact: Advanced UI/UX design is the core engine of conversion. By crafting sections that are not only visually stunning but strategically persuasive, we maximize the likelihood of users clicking those crucial CTA buttons and progressing to your affiliated website. This directly and significantly impacts your primary objective.
Holistic Website - ""No Crumbs Left"":  ""Complete & Polished Experience""

Assessment: ""No crumbs left"" signifies a website that is meticulously polished and complete in every detail. No broken links, no placeholder content, no inconsistencies. It's about demonstrating professionalism and attention to detail at every touchpoint.
Action Items:
Content Review: Scrutinize all website copy for clarity, grammar, and tone. Ensure all content is up-to-date and relevant.
Visual Consistency Check (Final Pass): Re-examine the entire website for visual inconsistencies. Are there any pages that deviate from the established theme?
Performance Optimization: Website speed and performance are critical UX factors. Optimize images, minimize code, leverage browser caching, and consider a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to ensure fast loading times. Slow websites kill conversion rates.
Cross-Browser & Cross-Device Testing (Final): Conduct thorough testing on all major browsers and devices to ensure consistent functionality and visual presentation.
Accessibility Considerations (WCAG Compliance - Basic): Ensure basic accessibility principles are considered (e.g., sufficient color contrast, alt text for images) to make the website usable for a wider audience.
Executive Impact: A holistically polished website conveys professionalism, trustworthiness, and attention to detail. It reinforces the image of a high-quality offering and increases user confidence, contributing to higher conversion rates and a stronger brand reputation.
Serious Executive Review Conclusion:

This review framework prioritizes action and results.  By systematically addressing each of these areas, you will transform your website into a high-performing conversion machine.  The emphasis on bold design, persuasive messaging, and flawless execution isn't just about aesthetics; it's about strategically engineering a user experience that compels visitors to take action and click those CTAs.  This detailed assessment provides a roadmap for creating a website that is not just ""good,"" but truly exceptional and strategically aligned with your primary business objective: driving traffic to your affiliated website.

00:08:01	wanted to sell it online and then figured out what Bitcoin was that was the first time I heard of Bitcoin that movie came out in 2015 and I started doing some research and then in 2016 that summer after I was working my ass off I bought as much ethereum as I could and uh I've been holding it ever since and in 2021 sadly my older brother passed away so that really put me in like a dark place it just made me want to stay at home in my room all day and then my one friend called me up he was like bro I know you have a bag of crypto

----------
00:00:00	Donald Trump launched the meme coin this is something completely unexpected the last 2 days I've actually just been trying to realize what's happening right now in the trenches I completely missed this play Let's talk about it so two days ago Trump posted on true social this picture right here which contained AA and people thought that it was a hack it went off on a lot of people's like true social monitors it went off a lot on a lot of like Twitter monitors as well cuz people started to tweet about

00:00:25	it on our own CT tracker in potion I mean we caught this on at 9:08 p.m. on Friday because spy had tweeted is this a hacker a real post and this is when Trump had tweeted it on true social for minutes after the post I mean I was trying to get information on it which is why I track spy cuz he always has like such good research and it's at 9:08 p.m. so it is when I got alerted right I saw that and 9:08 p.m. Brothers this is still right here like I mean I want to I want to go all the way back really and and talk about like how

00:00:55	early I was to this how early everyone in potion was to it but being early doesn't matter if you're not able to play it well like literally right here is where spy tweaks at and I see it like between 300 and 800 mil I actually end up even buying some at one bill but I don't even think it's real anymore so I I sell I never thought that just would happen it's a really good launch Pro I mean they have 86% of the of the token you know vested and locked throughout 3 years and it was on their website and honestly I was at a

00:01:25	restaurant when I saw this launch and I just saw a lot of fot on my timeline I saw a lot of people saying it wasn't real and even my personal opinion I didn't think that something like this would be real but I guess in hindsight it it should have been obvious that the true social post didn't get deleted after 30 minutes and then it went up on his Instagram I mean Twitter but yeah like shit's locked for 3 years the official partnership with moonshot it was instant listed on moonshot there were so many factors that like proved it

00:01:52	was real but I don't know I don't know like I I really struggled with this chart some of my best friends have ended up retiring off of this like go to top Traders bro and you the go TT is up 18 mil Nim is up 8 9 mil on just his main wallet Durant is up another 8 mil look Nim's other wallet he's up another three 4 mil like zerox Sun's up a mil profit up Mill and then like even in the holders bro like people are still holding like pal has 23 mil in token left bro MIM from versus 15 mil like so many people changed their lives on this

00:02:29	Trump token I don't know what I was doing like genuinely I don't know why I didn't like end up buying I was just like I was struggling so much to find out if it was real or not like I tweeted at 9:33 Trump launched the meme coin I wasn't home what do we think do I ape here like blast it goes to five bill today minimum and now it's at 50 Bill hearing it's not real will fade like I just I was scrolling to Twitter and I I couldn't believe that this was real that this could like actually happened and

00:02:55	like I just spent like the last 2 3 days just coping wow like you know you see all he's like seven fig eight figs pan in the timeline it's like this was the play that like you spend you know the last year kind of trying to get ready for like this is like the play that when you talk about having like Twitter monitors and like all this important water trackers this is that play that's like such an obvious narrative that you should like just a but it's easier to say it's obvious now right cuz I had the chance to ape you know all the

00:03:21	way here but um it is what it is I I want to talk about a few things I wanted to talk about you know good traders who really change your lives to this trade and should follow and then I want to kind of talk about I where I think the the Market's heading I mean if you guys want to buy this coin I'm not suggesting you do or you don't but it's like know on every sex and like coinbase Kraken binance Etc and if you ever want to be able to buy a coin early before it gets to sell on sex my referral links will be

00:03:48	listed down below to Nova which is a trading bot that I use it's a telegram trading bot right here but yeah BR like so many good Traders change your lives to this coin EQ turned like six figs into eight figs Jaylen it's cra I see so many good pnls right he tweeted his p&l it was five figs into seven figs let's see who else Isa had a really good Pano as well his was like like this is really inspiring you know $400 into $2.4 million like this almost feels like unbelievable you get what I'm saying but like it's literally just been

00:04:20	like what my timeline has been full of like every day like even if we scroll through my timeline like I'm sure we'll see a trump piano somewhere uh right here nuke fnf made $10 million I mean I saw another one from from versus boys like they just updated their current p&l made $153 million Kenzo who you guys have seen on the channel before you know cooked or was it I think he deleted his tweet but he cooked on it Notch cooked on it you know 800k so many so many good traders that you know we've been talking

00:04:49	about now for almost a year cooked so hard on this coin and like the truth is there will never be another Trump president launching a meme coin but um you know what is good this is going to bring a lot of new people into our Market it's going to bring a lot of fresh liquidity it's going to bring a lot of people interested in the trenches uh if this is your first time ever watching a meme coin video and we've been doing this for almost a year now of like straight Runners like this every single day obviously not to the

00:05:12	caliber of Trump launching a mem coin I mean I don't think we've even had a two Bill Runner yet but in the pump fun new pair like trenches you're able to find coins that just come out at like 9k and you know you're able to buy them and we've had like 100 Mill Runners one bill Runners so many different we've just been doing this for the last year and now that there's going be like so much new fresh liquidity coming I think crypto is really going to take off this year I mean it's looking like it right Trump's launched the D5 protocol

------------
00:00:00	about 1 year ago I started putting in 10 plus hours a day into the meme coin trenches every single day and I documented the entire process on this YouTube channel right here starting all the way back in March I have learned so much From The Trenches and I made endless videos on how to get good at this thing but I want to talk about today all the lessons that I learned in 2024 while trading mem coins look first things first you have to understand that when you're starting out to trade mem coins you're competing against people

00:00:24	who have been doing this for a year 10 plus hours a day I mean you go on a calculator here that's literally 10x like 365 hours day people have like 3,000 Plus hours on this screen right here so don't expect like this going to come easy making millions of dollars in the trenches it's not something that like just comes overnight you're not going to get that good overnight it takes a lot of time I see a lot of people like start scanning and start trenching and like some of them do get good really fast but a lot of that is

00:00:47	like depends on who who your friends are like your circle who you're surrounded with if you have like no one that's going to put you on to how to trade meme coins other than like this YouTube video it's going to take you a lot of time you are competing against other people it's literally like a video game the more hours you put in the better you'll get you don't want to M Max here like you want to get good at literally every single part about trading meme coins whether that be like understanding what

00:01:08	to scan here understanding like CT culture understanding how to read the chain understanding how to read clo and look at people's pnls understanding like when they got in why they got in understanding like who they are like there's so many different aspects of meme coin trading that's like the number one thing that you have to understand like this won't come overnight this is a skill you become just good at over time so the more time you put in the better you'll get at this but like generally the amount of money here here that you

00:01:30	can make is UN like it's uncapped I mean you look at like someone like csy you look at someone like profit there's like insane pnls like $1.1 million in like the last few months last 30day p&l $4.6 million I mean even yesterday like profit himself cooked tremendous like $1.16 million on one coin in 5 minutes because of a snipe $38,000 into $1.2 million within minutes oh I just want to go ahead and get that out of the way let's start talking about everything I learned in 2024 as a mean coin Trader I

00:02:01	um when I first started trading just like looking back at like my old videos um a lot of what I used to do obviously people always ask me orange how much money did you lose before you started winning and dude when I started trading in March there was no such thing as like trading pump on coins okay we were all trading on photon and we were on new pairs okay so like this is what we were trading new pairs there was no pump Vision so like I started and look how many coins were being made a second like

00:02:25	you had like five coins every minute now you have like five coins every second pump fun made it really easy to make coins and back here you had to worry about like liquidities getting pulled and getting rug pulled once like pump fun was introduced into Photon I think that's like when everything really changed and we started going from like this meta of just having to like scan new pairs now we were scanning pump funds and I started to track wallets around this part I think this is where I really realized like hey tracking

00:02:49	wallets is like super important there used to be like a really big K influencer back in the day Mr Frog he used to have like a lot of motion on pump funs and if you were able to just like hey Mr Frog bought and you were able to like manually copy trade like really really fast fast before copy trading Bots were a thing you have the chance of making a lot of money I started realizing that like one of the most important things that you could do is tracking wallets looking at every single coin that's been performing

00:03:11	throughout the day and fting those top Traders and trying to find who they belong to so for example like if you go on Twitter and you look up metal metrics who tweets out like these daily Recaps of like everything that's going on in the trenches right and you're able to like find like understand the current narratives because everything I realized about meme coins was like every coin behind it has a narrative how many people do I think I can get in before so like for example Peanut the squirrel

00:03:34	when peanut got kidnapped by the NYPD when it got killed obviously that was going to make very big news mainstream and how many people do you think you could get in before on pcoin before it became mainstream and got listed on binance coinbase and hit $2 billion market cap evaluation so every coin you have to think about it like that you're placing a bet on any coin you're placing a bet that you think is undervalued right like odds are really are really in your favor and you're hoping that more

00:03:57	people start catching on and then your chart kind of just like looks like for Meo yesterday tweeted about all these coins and what I would do if I was just starting is I would go to a lot of these top Trader coins and look through all these wallets and eventually I would just start to find who they belong to so like this is a top Trader on L he bought 1.1 mil and he's up like almost 2 mil unrealized on it I TR to go on Twitter search for the wallet um as you can see here he's like made a lot a lot of good

00:04:19	trades and um you know I check the p&l check on Soul scan maybe the wallet is named maybe I can find something that helps me um get closer to whose wallet it is but right here just I'm being on soci SC I would never track this wallet because it's very clear to me that there's a bot making tens of transactions um a second so I can kind of skip this wallet actually and kind of go here to a wallet that looks like they made a legit trade by putting some good money in uh and making a lot I'm going to go ahead here and like this wallet

00:04:45	turned $500 into 178k and I want to see whose wallet this belongs to I want to see if anyone's tweeted the wallet or anything like that as you can see here a lot of these wallets a lot of this wallet has been traded before I can look on cow try to find it overall p&l it looks like it's been cooking overall not just on L and I'm not able to find who the wallet belongs to it's not named it has no soul scan name but it's okay I can continue to track this wallet right like if I want to add the wallet to my wallet

00:05:14	tracker right and be like LM top Trader 20 I understand that means it's a top Trader a top 20 Trader on the coin LM I just kind of want to speedrun this video a little bit because so many different things I learned in 2024 but it's just like things like that right like if you put in the work and you're trying to look through hundreds of wallets and you can start pay up wallets because all it takes right is for like somebody to like have twe that wallet like for example like though say you saw like my wallet

00:05:38	right one this is one of my old wallets by the way let's say you saw this like cook on like eagle coin or kuki or whatever and you look at the wallet obviously like this wallet has been um tweeted about a lot Insider alert it's funny um it's funny I look at my wallet here and like people think it's Pal's wallet or whatever uh it doesn't look like there's like any direct Association oh actually right here um yeah like this guy said I gated this coin and uh like right here it was very clear that like

00:06:00	this was orange wallet so it just takes like things like that to kind of start associating people with their wallets that was like the number one thing I realized I need to start doing um tracking different fnf wallets I remember back when I was uh starting to trade I was trying to join Alpha groups uh fnfs and I didn't have a lot of friends me and my friends were playing fortnite we had just started trading so we started paying for groups we started paying for like Digi World shock pastel whatever until the point where like we

00:06:23	got pretty good in these groups pretty known in these groups like we were really really active every single day and then you get like invited to like private groups and I had actually gotten invited to this private group that was pretty good uh it was like a the better version of what was considered to be like Digi world right versus fnf I got invited to this because of Digi world so Digi world is like the paid version group and then their private group is like versus fnf I got invited to versus

00:06:46	and I learned a lot of things there I I met a lot of people that was like the most important part cuz like you're joining these Alpha groups that are paid you want to meet people right like you want to make your time like super valuable in there you don't just like want to buy every just put in there and eventually I met a lot of good people in versus a lot of those people became like close friends uh I got invited to like Alpha chats like different ones and you know just hardcore trenchers and I just

00:07:06	met people from there right I kept meeting people from all these different Alpha chats and like you know now I have like all my Alpha chats open on the side you know cupsy assassin cisy whatever and that really helped me but I ended up getting kicked from versus because I gave like a like a few bad calls or whatever like got into like some drama some people like the point was like you know being in versus allowed me to gather a lot of good wallets a lot of like hey that fnf the this is a list of

00:07:29	their wallets like me more people gave me access to so many wallets that I wouldn't have found on chain cuz they were just like more lowkey and nobody really knows but like you know understand who they are now that was like the number one thing as far as like onchain skill goes was was to understand how to track um how to read the chain okay another few things right when you're buying meme coins and you're just starting you are like super super emotionally attached to your coin you're also super like Community member um if I

00:07:53	can just give one tip here if we can go through like my public wallet here go through the biggest losses I want to go ahead and show something because we do this thing in potion every day right there's like as you can see right here there's a call going on right now in potion with like 400 people in here and there's a chat here and when I go onto the stage I realize that whenever I review people's wallets a lot of them are holding to zero so number one tip that I would give is like never hold your coin past 8090 as you can see here

00:08:18	all my biggest losses were cut very very early - 3450 25% 56% 53 20 I never allowed myself to get to 90 plus I only had one90 p&l and it was bit gr and I got Meed on this coin so as soon as I bought I didn't have met protection on and I got I lost all my money instantly um that can be avoided by having met protection on which you should always have on on your trading bot Nova that's like the number one thing number one Rie mistake I see with a lot of new Traders is that they buy coins and when you buy

00:08:44	a coin you have to understand a few things right when it's like a brand new pump fund you're basically kind of like you're placing a bet and you're hoping other people also see the bet you're placing right and you're trying to get it at good odds but sometimes like pump funds get so oversaturated that like these coins just never get anywhere if you're buying like extreme new pairs um once this coin's like about to graduate and stuff like I would say it's a little bit safer but yeah I I never allow

00:09:06	myself to lose more than like 40% 50% on a coin and I don't set a stop loss ever because like stop losses can Wick you out of like these like pump funs and stuff so don't have like automatic stop loss and set up just like in your mind in your heart understand that like you want to cut your losses pretty early um at least that's like what's worked for me right you never want to become a Community member of any cat you never want to like be super emotionally attached to it it'll make you like not

00:09:25	be able to sell like for example salana cringe cat if I like fell in love okay if I fell in love with this community right for some reason um and I became like a Community member I was in the telegram 24/7 and like the coin doesn't end up working out now I feel like so emotionally attached to everyone else who's also a Community member uh that I would just never be able to sell and I'm just going to be losing all my money and that's not worth it okay another tip that I have written down is I learned to

00:09:46	be really really fast so like clicking through a lot of stuff this is like basic tips by the way right clicking through a lot of the social medias of these coins I understood that like you got to look at it really really fast so like this is more like scanning new pairer tip whenever you see a coin that you think looks good and you want to click on the link right it takes a few seconds for it to load so while it's loading you want to stay looking at this page and so I press with my middle Mouse

00:10:07	button right like I press this down right here and it'll open the tab and then I have my fingers on control and W ready to close the tab right so I'm looking at new pairs to see if anything is coming out right like La Fire Dog missing okay this doesn't look it would be a terrible narrative right this could potentially hit the news because of everything that's going on right now in La um but I'm just going to avoid it because it was like a random news in a different language that tweeted it I don't know if it'll do too good but when

00:10:29	I'm I'm opening tabs I'm middle Mouse buttoning it so once it's loaded I can take a quick look at it um and then I can control W to close the tab control W to close a tab um the point of this is to get really really fast even when I open a coin I keep a tab with new pairs open cuz I don't want to like miss out on anything right everything I'm doing like I just got really good at doing it fast that' be like checking the chain checking where the wallet got funded from um all this type of stuff just like

00:10:52	you get you want to get like really really fast with it right cuz it does a game a speed at the end of the day even if you like decide to sell like market cap filters which I've been personally using recently like a 10K Mark cap filter so you're not like getting super oversaturated um with every coin that's like getting put out ex set filters have your water tracker open on the side and basically like anything that's like coming out should be able to uh just be really fast and be able to look at it

00:11:12	really quickly like biosphere came out 47 seconds ago I want to take a look at it just open it up real quick control W 6 hours ago it hasn't tweeted so I can just go ahead and close this and that's just like a lot of what I'm doing to be honest since tweeted this I just got it on my CT tracker as well that's why somebody made a coin about it uh that's why time I do came out but that's not even the name of uh the thing obviously you can see trenches here like timy asking what's his name like Harold

00:11:34	asking what's his name obviously these guys are in the trenches and you got to understand this like at this point there's like thousands of people in the trenches so the competition is like at an alltime high right now so if you want to get good at this you got to get like good really quick and there's a lot to catch up right there's like a lot of catch up you got to play so yeah it it um it could be a little overwhelming like getting like really fast at it but there's also like the other side to it

00:11:51	right like let's say you don't have like a [ __ ] ton of time and you kind of just like want to buy meme coins and like want to invest in [ __ ] right like what's this for example oh in red Breck okay and there's also like the other part of it right because let's say you don't have like a ton of time but you want to still be exposed to the money you can make in meme coins and you just want to like go on photon go on bullex normally whatever and buy coins like you can still do that like let's say you wanted

00:12:10	to buy fart coin after you saw like all these news Medias were tweeting it obviously there's a side of just like buying the coin and holding it for a long time trying to make a lot of xes on it because obviously like you know being able to get down here like sub 55 like you can make like so much money but that's like not my personal trading style so like this channel is definitely catered to like wanting to get in like super super low cap type of [ __ ] and just like be really really early to it

00:12:31	like Owen live my first what is this my first live stream this guy Owens chill is live I mean I'll I'll bite I guess just like give an example right pre-recorded fake that's what people are saying here in the comment section I don't even have audio on this right now so I don't really know what's going on um bro 19 minute stream out of my own why is it going up like obviously we can understand that like there's a bunch of trenchers in here also looking at this coin right now and I'm just like trying

00:12:53	to see what's going to happen here like is this a coin type of f here let me put on my audio second can I actually hear what he's saying oh he ended the stream oh my God that's so bad okay I ended up losing actually point two I was up I was actually up like two so at one point but I ended up losing 40 bucks got R bad little kid that's unfortunate whatever go next um but like things like that are going to happen all the time and I was willing to place a bet I was willing to place a bet like you know little kid

00:13:16	making being live making a coin was like a funny enough narrative to probably go to like 100 200k and um I was willai to stick with my own conviction there and just in general I like another big tip I learned throughout this year was uh sticking with my own conviction a lot of like me and my friends really really learned this right so there's also like a downside to tracking wallets is uh you can let them like influence your decisions and your conviction let's say like you really really like a coin like

00:13:36	peanut for example uh you really like peanut you really like the narrative but then you see like all your favorite Traders like kind of just like ging out of the coin and you're like damn if like profit incentives csy are like all selling this coin even orangey like is there really a reason for me to hold it and you decide to sell and then you look like you look back to the coin a day later and it's like at 200 mil there's like a good side and a bad side to Confluence which is like when people influence your convictions you just want

00:13:55	to make sure that like you're surrounded by the right the right people that you're getting Confluence from the right people like if whoever affects your Confluence like you should just try to reach out and be like hey why did you sell this coin why did you buy this coin um but again don't become like super emotional don't become a Community member uh just try to have like your own conviction built up with your own friends uh don't let the chart affect you I could have made so much more money just believing in like a lot of these

00:14:14	coins I was in a lot of coins very very early like I was in fog at like 200k fog went to like almost a bill and I could have just like held and made like a [ __ ] ton of money obviously another tip is just like keep up to date on everything right keep up to date on like CT info keep up to date on Twitter like all day you want understand what is going on with CT keep up to date with the meta keep up to date with like Tik Tok Trends with everything like for example like you want to just understand what's going

00:14:37	on I just made a [ __ ] ton of money on this uh meme coin called tweaker I actually bring it up right here I don't have it on so like this coin if you guys don't know what this is It's like a Tik Tok Trend wait guys I was recording this video uh and anyone who doesn't know I live with like a few other trenchers and this guy got me a potion it's fire all right anyway so like this coin tweaker I was like in here I don't have it on my a it cuz I bought on Nova but I was down on twiger super early and this is like a liangelo

00:15:04	balls um T song and I saw that it was like getting posted by every social media page and I literally got like a 100 I got like 100k entry on this bro and I I like forgot about it I said and forgot literally I end up setting got 2 mil I actually paper handed some cuz it went like way higher yeah like I was able to catch this type of coin because of like being super active on socials on Tik Tok Instagram like understanding what like my gen Z culture is talking about gen Z culture like literally runs

00:15:30	Ming points so being able to keep up with the program is really it you know obviously tracking CT just using a ton of tools there's like a really good tool that I've been using a lot in potion recently I'll show this real quick it's like okay there's one really good boand here that um if you see like a good project right you can do/ scam and it'll kind of show up like this right if they've ever tweeted a contract address before and deleted the tweet this command will actually tell you whether or not they've done that like for

00:15:53	example I can go to bot commands do like SL scam and do like orangey it'll tell me if I've ever like scammed a coin and I can say no deled tweets found for orang no gam only tracks deleted tweets that compain the pump off on link so really good tools are coming out just like being up to date with every tool that's coming out whether that be like joining potion or just doing it yourself with your friends um so many different things are coming out every day to like help Traders get better like keep you

00:16:13	with like the latest trading programs like use Nova and that's it that's like really the most authentic way of everything I've learned in 2024 trading meme coins like I really just got fast understood how to switched from narrative to narrative really quickly got pretty good at trenching um was surrounded by good people by joining different Alpha groups groups and just like becoming friends with people and that that means you joining private Alpha group understanding the crypto Twitter culture I mean that that just

00:16:36	like required a lot of time a lot of this like whole game just requires time a lot of like getting good at this just requires a [ __ ] ton of time yeah guys that's really all I have to say thank you guys for watching this video if you enjoy drop a sub we're almost to 100K once we get to 100K I'll do a giveaway or something give out some salana so if you want to participate subscribe to the channel and yeah B orangey and I'm out I hope you guys can kill beam coins in 2025 peace



--------------------

00:00:00	last year I told myself I was going to start trading me coins and I documented the entire process on this YouTube channel and ended up making millions of dollars in 2024 in this video I'm going to condense all of the information I learned during that year and put it all into one video and make the best guide on how you can start trading meme coins in 2025 and potentially make a [ __ ] ton of money so I want to assume everybody knows how to get to this page you buy Solon on a centralized exchange like

00:00:22	coinbase and Kraken send that over to your Phantom wallet make an account on bullex all the links to the platforms I talk about in this video are going to be linked in the description down below so you're going to need bulock you're going to need Nova and you're going to need a wallet tracker that's all we're going to need for this video so right here you're looking at every single coin that is coming out on this Sal blockchain and you need to get really really good at identifying bad meme coins really fast

00:00:39	this is not an easy thing to do this is not a skill that comes overnight you are competing against people that have been trading meme coins for 20 plus hours a day for the last year people like cupsy like Urus like Waddles like stacky people who are making hundreds of thousands of dollars yes hundreds of thousands of dollars a day I mean we can go ahead here and look at cbs's wallet who is like one of the best pump fun Traders and he's made $262 in the last 24 hours we go to his 7day p&l he's made $1.3 million and in the

00:01:07	last month alone he made over $4.1 million and this is just one example of one Trader whose wallet we will be tracking throughout this video and this is not to copy trade anybody because copy trading Traders will make you lose money but if you see the same Traders buying all of the same coins that is a really really good sign at okay this coin might actually be something good A lot of the identifying good meme coins comes from from Confluence from other people giving you their conviction their thesis their ideas and you kind of

00:01:37	forming like hey I think that this coin could also do really good but we'll get into that later in the video let's follow the plan I have for this video you're on the screen and you need to get really good at identifying bad meme coins really fast and all of these coins here that are coming out are coins that potentially could go to zero and rug in seconds I really cannot stress the importance of trading alone please do not trade alone trade with other people if you don't have anyone to trade with

00:02:00	with join a group like potion potion right here discord. g/p potion Alpha it'll also be linked in description down below anyways to look at a lot of these meme coins and to be able to identify them fast we need to get really good at checking if like Twitter's are R used for example right there okay I clicked on this Page's Twitter I went I'm here on the Twitter okay I do SL Twitter reuse get the username really quickly and I can see that this Twitter has not been reused it's still the same username

00:02:25	so I'm pretty confident now that whatever coin I check their socials has not been used that's like one less factor of that coin potentially rugging now for example let's turn on this Neo vision chart right here that allows us to look at bundled charts or at any mem coin chart and let's try to find a Coin that's bundled I have a few filters on here but I want to find a Coin that looks really bundled like this one PLC if you ever see a coin that looks like this do not buy this because this right here is the number one indicator of a

00:02:54	coin being a scam and now when we copy the contract address and go back into the bot commands in potion we can go ahead and do bundle and we can check if this coin has been bundled and there's going to be an obvious yes but there are a few different coins I mean there are a few different tools that we use to check bundles as you can see we have three different Bots that pull from three different apis to tell if a coin is bundled the coin we just checked PLC has been bundled and it shows us all the

00:03:19	transactions that happened in the same block and how much exactly all of them bought for and how bundled it really is yeah coins like this never never buy also you might see as well I want to talk about this really quickly that I'm take to or on Instagram you may see people be like I bought $5 a coin it was $200,000 but I was never able to sell if that's happening to you that's because you are buying coins on new pairs these are all the coins that are coming out on chain okay and a lot of these are ruged

00:03:44	so please avoid buying anything here stick to pump fun coins only pump Vision stick here and you will never be able to get into a honey pot you're never going to be able to get into a rug pool no one can pull liquidity on you so just stick to buying pump funds only trust me this is number one safest way to buy meme coins in 2025 and the truth is man I just sit on the screen and I look at this for hours and hours a day and a lot of these coins that are coming out I can you know avoid because I've seen them

00:04:13	already done but look this is really really overwhelming okay for example one of the wallers I just track cubsy he just bought this coin called station it just came out a minute ago let's check this out I can do my own research real quick developer friendly API so it's just like an AI coin that's been pretty metal recently they haven't tweeted a CA yet though so I personally don't think that this is a real coin that does not mean though it may not fill another coin another um Trader I track Kenzo just

00:04:39	bought this coin as well I'm refreshing the Twitter page they still haven't tweeted anything out I don't see a reason for this coin to release a pump fund I don't see a reason for them to make a coin um but look now it's at 66k it's already 3x from where csy bought down here but um and now we have some more wallets buying cubsy just bought some more Kenzo sold some more more and I guess we can kind of keep this coin open to see if they end up tweeting it but my personal thought process is that they haven't tweeted since December 20th

00:05:08	they haven't been hyping up that they're going to release a coin so for that reason I faded it though it did fill it did go to 90k a lot of this you know research I just did just made me fumble a potential 5x you know I could have put 1,000 bucks in gotten 5,000 bucks out but you know I decided to do my research I'm going to stick with my thesis and not look at this and we can come back to this to some migrating because every pump fund coin starts here at 6K and it has to hit 90k to hit the radium

00:05:36	liquidity pool which is like the Main salana Place okay so yeah scanning here can be really beneficial I want to go ahead and suggest some filters so that this isn't so much noise right you can go market cap minimum 15,000 and then here it's going to make it a lot easier for you to scan okay because you're not going to have all this influx of this noise and you can really just wait and see what other people are buying make sure you're tracking a lot of wallets and we'll talk about how to find those

00:05:58	wallets like enemy coin art one of my wallets just bought this um and it looks like it's going to zero they didn't tweet out the ca which is something I I'm always looking for but you know the art looks good on this could potentially be something they have a website um we can go ahead and click on their socials on their telegram if I want to I can join their telegram join their social see if they're like hyping up a potential CA drop um but we're not going to do all of that right now one of my other wallets

00:06:25	and irocks just bought this coin here yeah once I have this filtron of 50 ,000 I'm going to have a lot less noise a lot less coins that are coming out you know I'm going to be able to handle the amount of coins that are coming out now and then the most important thing as well is having a CT Tracker open this is available in potion potion Alpha we reopen on January 6th on Monday and then you'll be able to use our tools again uh we've been like really really really redefining what it means to have a alpha

00:06:50	group and I think I'm really excited for the reopening and making everybody in there a really good Trader having a CT tracker gives me the ability to keep up on everything that's happening in crypto Twitter because that's the most important part of this also AI station coin just came out and yes csy did catch it at 20K it did fill but now it's at zero because we stuck to the fundamentals of it okay and one of the things I could have done is bought in I could have had major fomo and bought into this coin but I decided not to

00:07:16	because I stuck to my research thesis and I decided to not buy this coin because it didn't have my checklist you know I have a checklist in my mind that I'm going through have they tweeted the ca have the the Twitter been reused like I'm checking so many different things to try to make sure a coin isn't a rug and I wasn't comfortable buying this coin which is why you know now it's at literal zero I mean if you bought up here you would have taken a huge loss the top tra on this made two grand which

00:07:41	was the dev the dev rug for 2K and you know I'm sure if you take a look at the biggest loss here it's like probably a few thousand so look tracking Twitter is the number one thing because the other day Elam mus changed his name to kikus Maximus and the coin on Solana went to 25 mil as soon as he changed that name we got an alert here on CT track that Ela musk changed his name and profile picture okay but you need to be really really careful these type of coins because as soon as Ela musk changed his name back I want to show you

00:08:08	exactly what happened okay Elon Musk updated his profile and he changed it back to this Elon Musk and the coin on ethereum hit 400 mil we're are trading on Solana this video is only about Solana coins but even here you can see the insta redwick down okay boom instantly went from 20 mil down to 1 mil as soon as he changed his name and on ethereum the coin went from 400 mil all the way down to 100 Mil so with these type of like Twitter tracker plays you need to be really really careful again do not fall in love with any of these

00:08:37	coins do not become a Community member your only goal here is to make money as quick as possible that is the number one thing that helped me I became a total like I sell everything super fast I'm a paper hander I have never you know I'm not I'm never going to hit like 100x or 1,000x but my wins are going to slowly slowly stack over time and that's really all you need to do you need to make a few thousand do on every single play or a few hundred on every single play until you're able to keep stacking up your

00:09:01	portfolio you don't need to go for the six figure the seven figures the eight figure plays I mean just literally take a look at cbs's wallet and study this wallet okay I mean look at his one day P his biggest trade was 29k on a 270k day I mean he has so many trades out if we scroll through 2K 2K 1K 1K 900 800 700 600 500 400 you know and the list goes on and he just keeps stacking these wins yeah get really good at you know the the crypto culture the crypto Twitter culture you need to understand who are

00:09:26	good kws who are scammers and that you know that's something that just comes experience that's something that comes from meeting other people in Alpha groups like potion that's going to be link description down below like pastel like shock like yoga vers like Digi world like Kaizen like pump on trenches you know just any other crypto community that people talk about that's how you learn crypto culture that's how you learn crypto Twitter you know it it comes from other people's knowledge and who's good at what they do and who's

00:09:52	just like a scammer all right so now number two thing on our list is tracking wallets and we've talked about how to find wallets before and I'll go through it really quick okay on Neo bulock they have a top Trader feature you can go here to the top traders of every any single coin and you can name this wallet so for example if I click on the wallet here I'm able to rename it I can rename it mad top Trader I can copy the wallet and I can put it into my potion wallet tracker I can add it here boom boom and

00:10:17	add a nickname and then all the transactions that wallet does is going to pop up and now you may think to yourself well why do I want to track wallets what is that even good for look when all the best traders in the world are buying something like a narrative may have come out that's super obvious or like you know when Trump got shot there was like a ton of like Trump earshot meme coins or when the Doge owner got another dog you know all these wallets were top blasting this coin tracking wallets does not mean copy

00:10:42	trade okay most people know they're being tracked so you do not want to copy trade but you should definitely use wallet tracking because it literally all it does it it pretty much helps you feel more confident on the thesis you were already building imagine you bought a coin on pump fund that you thought could be a really good meme coin and then you see all these really good Traders just top blasting your coin buying your coin your conviction in that coin is going to get so much stronger now because all

00:11:06	these other wallets that you're tracking are also getting in and you're going to be able to see who's still holding who's selling and all this stuff is going to influence you into making your decision on trading which is a good thing okay I think it's a really good thing to be tracking wallets you need to be tracking wallets and then another good thing with tracking wallets is also tracking the devs so for example if somebody made a coin and that coin went to 50 million okay I can go on the pump fund profile

00:11:30	okay let's find an example we just had a coin literally a few minutes ago go to like 40 mil so what I'm going to do here is set the market cap minimum to 2 mil so that I'm able to look for the coin and it was apy so I can go on apy go on the pump fun chart and right here copy this wallet and then I can add it to my wallet tracker right as apy Dev and now if that wallet does anything like create another wallet I mean another coin or buy a coin or sell a coin or anything right these type of plays are so

00:11:59	beneficial um whether it be like influencers or celebrities or live streaming pump funs I mean this is how I've made a lot of my money as well a lot of them will be live streaming they show their wallet and people start making coins and sending that coin to their wallet like they'll send like a 50% or whatever there a really really really good way for you to make money there you know and you just need to do research on everything you're doing I mean this is just a game of research a lot of this is just spending time here

00:12:23	spending time on chain reading Soul scan like a few months ago I had found out that one of the dev wallets I was tracking which is bundling the same coins over and over again and I started tracking all those wallets and every time that they would buy a coin I would also buy because I knew that they were just scamming and those scams would go really really really high and I was able to make a lot of money on lar as we call it lar is just like fake coins scams rug poles whatever but you're able to make

00:12:47	money on this at the end of the day all of these m coins go to zero so like technically all of it is like just one big scop one big large but if you're really really early and you can just sell when the chart goes up I mean you're going to make money I mean this is just this is just like the truth of it look at all these meme coins that have come out right these all went eventually to 90k I mean look at like AI station for example we showed earlier in the video but even like game right this coin eventually did come out on pump fun

00:13:11	right it did come out at 6K it went all the way up to 300K which is really good for a meme coin low key and now it's dead and this is just some like AI Twitter that's just fake you see and now they're tweeting we're not live do not buy any tokens avoid falling for fakes and they're just scoping you that's really all they're doing okay number one way to avoid this is literally just be trading with other people I cannot stress the importance of this I think that this is like the most underrated thing that people aren't really taking

00:13:35	into account in 2025 you do not want to be trading alone okay it is way too hard because people have such an advantage on you so get together with like 5 to 10 friends join Alpha groups like potion and just get to like putting in the time you need to put serious time in my friend scan for 10 plus hours a day 15 plus hours a day but it's going to be worth it because it is a temporary sacrifice for a permanent gain that's how I need to look at it look any free time you may have like please put it

00:13:59	into this even if like it's after work you're working 9 5 and then you get home at 600 like 6: to 10 you have 4 hours to trench okay use those 4 hours to like really good try to front run plays that you think may you know go up like Trends on Tik Tok Trends on Instagram just overall news that's happening because at the end of the day you're just trading news like you're trading news narratives anything that happens like for example Luigi right him getting arrested I mean like that that whole situation there was

00:14:24	a coin that like if you were just keeping up with the news you were able to buy this coin super super early like I'm talking about you know this coin went all the way up let me turn off my track wallets here this coin went all the way up to 75 mil I mean now it's you know the news isn't that relevant anymore but there's tons of opportunities like this in the market every single day and you're just trading narratives your only focus is like look nobody can tell you hey when do you think I should sell when do you think I

00:14:47	should take initials how do I like stop getting rugged like these are coins that nobody can answer for you the number one thing is like you are trading coins that you think other people are also going to think like damn you know there's a good narrative this is something good that if other people find out about it I think they would also be interested in like putting their money into this and at the end of the day this is all just skill-based gambling like all everyone is just trying to buy [ __ ] and make

00:15:10	money that's why you're trading meme coins that's why you're watching this video you're trying to get absolutely filthy [ __ ] rich in 2025 and I think I mean everybody is hopping on to meme coins right now and it's super skill-based and I think it's a really good opportunity but again it's literally just a time thing like bulex pump vision is literally like a lottery ticket and you're looking for a th X year to spawn and you just stack up those small ones right these small wins and that's literally it you have to be

00:15:37	Al online a lot you have to understand the current metas you have to understand gen Z culture you have to understand crypto Twitter culture a really good guy for this that I really suggest following is melow metrics he has like tons tons tons of good info on all these new coins that come out every day and why these narrative runs like he does these daily meme coin Recaps they're just like Recaps on why certain coins did really good that day and when once you get good at like understanding all this and once

00:16:02	you start talking with other people and once you really like get yourself deep into the rabbit hole I think meme coins can make anybody a millionaire in 2025 I think that the like skill ceiling is very high so I think there's a lot of room for people to like come in and just start dominating out of nowhere and like you can play catch up pretty quick especially like if you're chronically online which I'm sure if you're like trying to be in this like entrepreneur make money crypto space you already are

00:16:26	B man I mean really all of this is just looking for coins that are rapidly gaining momentum looking for coins that are fitting curring n narratives chronically being online waiting for opportunities to fall on your hands tracking wallets that's all it takes to get rich with beam coins in 2025 I hope you guys enjoyed this video do me a favor drop a like drop a sub I'm trying to get to 100K Subs by the end of the year and I hope my content is able to help some of you guys out there become good meme coin Traders join potion we

00:16:52	reopen on January 6th but our we list is now open if you want to join springb orangy and I'm out peace


-----------------

00:00:00	what's the shortterm most you've made in like a day and the most you've made like long-term holding whatever it was okay so like within like almost a few minutes I made almost half a million dollars how much you put in like $2,000 how much money do you make seven figures seven figures a year yes a month how old are you I'm 21 you're 21 yes what do you do I make content on YouTube I trade crypto I run a trading platform form I do a whole lot of things what's your trading platform called uh potion potion yeah okay crypto trading

00:00:40	yes mem coins are all the rage this year yes are mem coins gambling that's my question that's your question it can be yeah it can be um I don't think so though explain I mean there's a specific reason why like it's the same people winning over and over again right if it was gambling it wouldn't be right so there's an edge to game there is an edge to game skill based gambling okay so I'll set the frame here you are you've killed it with memec coin trading you've been in the crypto space for a long long

00:01:12	time did you used to be an Esports Pro before this yes fortnite yes so you were professional fortnite player before this but it seemed there has been like a trend of professional for fortnite players killing it in meme coins I Saw's been killing it fortnite runs the meme coins yeah it's crazy but this year it's all about meme coins and there seems to be be like an actable strategy and Edge that you can develop you were really successful then you created your group called potion which is a paid Discord

00:01:39	community on [ __ ] that actually just teaches people how to trade meme coins and you built all these different tools I assume on top of well it started out as tools like we just um I was using a lot of things a lot of different tools to help me get an edge and I just put them on to a Discord put like a $20 payate behind it um and it grew into something much much bigger and we just started SC from there okay cool so I want to start with trading like the strategy to trading meme coins with I guess first and then we'll go into the

00:02:08	actual business that you've created because that's also really doing really well for you um so let's basically I want to start with like what were those initial tools and what are the different types of tools that help you trade yeah and then I want to go through the actual like what's the process of trading meme coins these days because a lot has changed since I've been involved in crypto last two or three years so like number one Edge number one tool that I was using for now everyone uses it I

00:02:31	mean I'm the one that made it public actually um which a lot of people don't like me for a lot of like the good Traders are against me you know giving out I guess um a lot of it started off with like Twitter trackers right like you would get really important notifications from different people like Ela musk whoever may be that may have tweeted some like funny picture some meme some slogan some I mean sometimes if you were tracking like certain crypto people they would tweet out like specific meme coins like contract

00:03:00	addresses of coins and if you were the first person to catch it I mean it would pump and Skyrocket so so just track tweets like the millisecond they came out before they even like hit the Twitter notification yeah like that was like number one Edge for months so it was literally just would you have to track the account first yeah you would have to specify what account you wanted tweeted uh you wanted to track like for example over the summer Andrew Tate was like crazy on on uh CT I'll be saying

00:03:25	that word a lot it's crypto Twitter okay um like he was really really popular tweeting out like ca's meme coin so tracking his Twitter and as soon as he would post a meme coin we would automatically buy it uh and there were tons of people like this route all of CT this last year that we were tracking so a simple form of This Is MeMe coins is basically just the price is it I really like the culture of meme coins because it's like people are kind of stopping pretending that there's like utility or

00:03:52	like a product behind it which is like a really big like manipulation tactic people did in the last bull run where it seems like everyone has just accepted that Meme coins kind of just like this like Hot Potato game but there is like if you are really deep in Internet culture there are like memes that are like just iconic throughout Decades of Internet history and so there seems like there is kind of like the systematic like different strategies you could use to kind of catch what is a real meme

00:04:17	coin that's going to hit the culture and go like blow up to hundreds of millions dollars in market cap versus just like someone trying to it's it's weird like there's like the subjective like actually is a real thing in a way but you're saying that at the beginning it's just like being the first one to gain access to this information about a popular figure tweeting a meme or a reference yeah so there's a big difference to what people to uh what like viewers probably know as meme coins they probably you know like

00:04:46	these big multi-million billion dollar market cap coins like Dogecoin Sheba I'm trading like pump fund coins pump fund is this crypto application where you can make a meme coin for literally free on your phone and it gets released so I'm seeing like you know hundreds of meme coins being created every minute and I'm just looking at this list all day until something pops up um I want you to imagine a scenario where Elon Musk tweets out a picture of his dog and he names the dog Rowdy right and Elon posts

00:05:17	a picture hey I just got this dog Rowdy I want you to imagine a screen where you're just seeing a ton of meme coins being created of this dog Rowdy like that's like you know where that Twitter tracker comes into play that's where all these different tools come into play as well um so it's almost like when a person of influence or a well-known person says something and if it come becomes a memeable moment people are throwing out five different coins and if it's actually going to be like a it's almost like you're investing in this

00:05:42	actually becoming a verified meme on the internet almost so you're just investing in attention economies like how long can things last an example was like um there a [ __ ] up example but like Luigi the guy did that thing like his meme coin when that first happened you know skyrocketed uh obviously you know it'll go down and stuff after people don't talk about it um Peanut the squirrel when peanut you know got kidnapped it went to a few million but when peanut got killed and it was going to be all

00:06:09	over the news peanut went to billions it got listed on coinbase binance whoa and like I was in peanut since 100K market cap like the second it came out I mean people were buying peanut like I have a crazy tweet we like uh I'm literally like Shilling peanut at 100K it's crazy so it's almost like a reflection of how viral something goes in the mly what like the pump on trenches which is what we call like we don't call it trading meme coins it's called The Trenches uh that is what trenches is like which one

00:06:35	of these meme coins has the best chance at going Baro best chance of being talked about like um people are always trying to front run like Elon Musk potentially talking about something we've seen this happened so many times like there was a a hamster um Fight Club uh meme coin that was like done by some like Harvard students or whatever the case was and people thought like the story had just come out and people were like damn might talk about this it's the type of thing he talks about and all my friends

00:07:03	bought this like you know under $5 million market cap and Elon tweets it elon's like what the [ __ ] this is so weird and it's skyrockets 50 mil they all make a 10x on whatever they put in like it's very attention based so it's almost like you're if you're like online 24/7 in the trenches you could see like the first seedlings or come up with like a hypothesis like some relevant person might make this a thing yeah you'll never miss out bro the game is like being chronically online and having like

00:07:28	the best tools like you know tracking the best wallets um there's so many different things that goes into it but yeah honestly trading mem coins has just how long can you be online and dedicated for for the last year of my life from like March up until maybe October no no up until like the end of November um I took a break for December it was the holidays and stuff like that but from March to December I basically never left my room like I was just like fully in the TR because it's all just about if

00:07:56	how fast you get the information and how early do you buy compared to everybody else and could be like 2 days long tops if that bro I'm us I don't really hold things like longer than a few hours like that's that's insane I I've made like insane amount of money in like minutes um I'll give you an example Steve will do it my Twitter he tweeted out a contract address and I bought it as soon as he tweeted out it was at 3 million I put um a few thousand in at like 3 four million it went up to 80 million I made

00:08:23	like 100 Grand in 10 minutes what's the most you made on one meme coin uh in like like long-term like quick like what do you mean just in general yeah what's give me both what's the short-term most you made in like a day and the most youve made like long-term holding whatever it was okay so like within like almost a few minutes I made almost half a million dollars how much you put in like $2,000 2,000 to half a million in a few minutes but this is different this isn't like trading meme coins it

00:08:52	was called sniping like basically there's a really really hyped launch going on and I was friends with like the best snipers on chain I gave him some my money he was like pulling a lot of money together we sniped we hit the first transaction the first Buy on that coin we hit and I mean so is sniping like basically you have a bot that like a new contract address is getting minted and then you just have like an automatic bot that's like anytime there's a new contract you have to like set requirements or is it just like yeah you

00:09:17	set requirements like how much like gas feed you want to waste and all that you're competing against other snipers essentially it is that like in the nft days yeah yeah so literally just right when a contract is minted automatically buy at this rate basically pretty much and then you just happen to hit one that happened to I mean I've sniped hundreds of tokens and it was just that one that like really got me hooked it's definitely just like casting the widest net possible a lot of small bets now

00:09:38	it's super like oversaturated and people have so much money that like the gas fees they'll run are like hundreds of thousands wow just for sniping even um one of the best Traders on chain he's going to watch this uh profit he spent $200,000 on just the fee to buy $30,000 of a token and he made a mill off of it so his like over on net profit was like over 800 Grand Wild free market is regulating like that in crypto that's very interesting so this is like basically what you're talking about how like when you were early on you were

00:10:06	making these tools and these were different strategies you could have deploy to kind of get an edge in the market basically so sniping is one of them like a year ago yeah it was super more profitable now it's like you're competing against people spending $200,000 fees imagine you're the guy that spent $190,000 on a fee you just got cooked yeah and and the meme dies interesting I saw k money he he uh he put me on by the way to what meme coins he he's the meme coin goat I remember when I met him he had like $300,000 in

00:10:33	Doge like last bull run it was nuts dude but he's really played this well but I remember like literally he tweeted that it was like kius Maximus because he predicted that Elon was going to change his profile picture to the meme how did he predict that do you know I do not know how he predicted it but I mean elon's a predictable guy when it comes to memes uh Elon changed his profile picture in his Twitter username to kikus Maximus that Meme went from zero literally zero brother I saw it get made

00:11:00	I was looking it went all the way to 300 million you want to know what happened when Elon changed his profile picture zero zero so just about knowing when to sell basically I mean the mo like our Twitter tracker would tell you Elon changed his pfb I had that tweet out bro that candle was a literal 300 mil candle to like less than 100 Mil like it was people lost a lot of money so crazy and Elon has done this a few times like he changed his pfp to a dark Maga version of Elon like I mean Elon is like the

00:11:30	crypto biggest K interesting K meaning key opinion leader which is like the fancy word for influencer yeah I learned that one recently so okay this is so interesting so you're going to pump. fun and you're just looking at all these different coins and you're trying to just like kind of map the attention economy like what is going to be relevant what could be like an extremely viral multimedia moment that goes mainstream that's literally I mean I at the basic level yeah that's it I don't use pump. fun because that's like a slow

00:11:57	version of trading but that's the platform where you can make the coin there's like a bunch of different trading Bots I use Nova personally Nova Nova what does Nova do it's like a it's like the best trading platform in my opinion so it's a platform it's like an ex where you can buy and sell pump funds it's like a I mean it's not an exchange you can't buy like Solana cryp is it like I'm Photon bulex Photon bulex okay is it like uh what was blur BL was an nft Marketplace uh yeah sure yes you kind of like that I'm dated broet

00:12:29	checked out okay so Nova what can you do on Nova other than just buy and sell like there a lot of different tools yeah Buy sell snipe um you can do anything I mean anything that any other trading bot can do but I think it's the fastest so interesting okay so where you're actually doing all this is on Nova yeah yeah is this all salana yes this is all salana based are so for the Twitter tracker are there any accounts that you are specifically following Elon uh Elon anom like all the big Twitter guys so

00:12:58	crypto Twitter guys yeah who who are big right now who's Big like who who are the goats right now yeah you know like the probably nothing boys like you know thread guy F Banks Frank um is Kobe tweeting Kobe oh my God I mean he's like obviously whenever he interacts with a me coin it [ __ ] goes crazy he's gone he's like just not he's retired though but he actually um he got sent supply of a meme coin he burned it and the meme coin went to 100 Mil so like Kobe's got hella pull M he's a goat tjr he's not super loved in like the

00:13:34	trenches but like a who do the trenches idolize I need to hear it who do they idolize I mean or who's like who's like s tier in the S tier in the trenches like the good Traders like profit like cubsy um Cordy like just like the lowkey thread guy Frank they're more K's okay right so it's different like we ID like people idolize them as like creators and KS and Frank is a really good traitor um but like when we're talking about like onchain skills like who are the best it's like you know it's po it's profit

00:14:06	it's cooker it's like the same people you can actually check uh there's like a leaderboard we have one as well in potion where you can check like the top Traders every day and they're trading from their main wallets for this I mean even if people try to get on new wallets eventually figure them out that's crazy okay so this is all making sense to me pump fund launches tokens on when the tokens launch you're kind of trying to pay attention to how much attention it's going to gather throughout crypto

00:14:29	Twitter ascends to the mainstream how big can it get the bigger it gets the bigger the market cap like mudang remember mudang Hipp that's a crypto that went crazy but now no one talks about mudang mudang fell off M off I telling my girlfriend this two days ago actually that's funny yeah my and one of my friends polar he lost like 400 Grand in mudang cuz he thought it was going to go ballistic see this is where it like feels like gambling right cuz like you do gambling on how much attention can it

00:14:51	get yeah but there is like a strategy and an edge to like being able to identify what will go viral like do you have the intuition for that and bro a lot of my trades are like really minuscule and like the grand scheme of things like I made I've made over a million dollars publicly on a wallet where my biggest trade wasn't even over 100k in profits like I'm scalping here for like 1K 2K 10K Max like I'm getting in so early on narratives that like by the time the non-experienced trenchers see them like I've already made my profit

00:16:48	but how are you able to find these narratives early like where by yeah I mean by using a trading platform by NOA because you can see every coin that's coming out so like you just stare at it all day like are you in groups with other Traders are you on Twitter like looking like yeah what would be like a signal to be like out of all the hundred that just launched in the last hour that's the one I'm going to put $2,000 into right yeah groups help a lot right like a group like potion pastel shocked

00:17:13	whatever obviously my private group like with my friends where we're just like all doing the same thing that's like an edge that no one can replicate like you are all looking at the same stuff and you know if something's being talked about in different chats like you know you can't miss it with a lot of people yeah at the end of the you're just trying to figure out if a lot of people will buy this and if you're in a group of a lot of people that's already like some sort of sort of like her mentality

00:17:35	and that's like the hardest thing right cuz like anyone who wants to get started has trouble finding people to trade with but do you think it's like you're young you're 21 a lot of these people in the meme coins are in their 20s they're online 247 do you think that there's some sort of like intuition of like internet kids that like internet kids are running the meme coin trenches what Edge do they have like what is it about I know if it's like being chronically online growing up but like I profit the

00:17:56	guy I told you about he's like 17 years old yeah so so it's like just like this you grew up on Tik Tok you've instilled a little brain rot in your brain I guess bro like that's actually how I think it's like the attention span of knowing like I'm going to get in and out super quick like a lot of these like older people in the trenches I see a lot of them like become community members fall in love with tokens I don't know if that's cuz like their attention spans aren't cooked and they can focus on a

00:18:18	coin for a long time but like I feel like all these like really young trenches are just like in and out super quick they they can't even focus on a coin for five minutes and so it's like their attention span is the actual their Norm is actually how like the lifespan of the market is behaving in a way and so they're just like in tune with it there's so many coins coming out like you got to pop this up on the screen of like just 10 seconds on like a trading platform you're going to see like hundreds of coins coming out oh my God

00:18:43	so I'm picturing that if I'm in the trenches I'm online chronically online 24/7 like I'm doing this seriously I have a I have six screens one screen is all the communities I'm in like Discord groups or DMS on Twitter I have six screens by the way yeah okay three three okay what is it what are the six screens okay okay I have on my top okay my top three are all Discord I have Discord groups from left to right then my Spotify on the top right bottom left I have the call that I'm in with my friends shout out Pioneer and then my

00:19:14	two telegram Alpha chats that I'm in which are like more private groups uh my main trading platform my CT tracker which is like where I'm tracking Twitter my wallet tracker and then um a telegram bot Nova to like start running sniping like any Snipes if I need to is there any AI you're sprinkling in here or is that not is that we're not there yet okay not there yet okay so Discord groups yep telegram groups what's the difference between those two or just same uh the Discord groups I'm in are like pretty more public the telegram

00:19:42	groups I'm in are usually like smaller chats of like just hardcore TR there like 20 people proba it's like your actual like team you're doing it with basically but then the Discord groups are stuff you can just join publicly and kind groups yeah you're trying to survey what is like the of course I'm in so many different groups bro that I've paid so much money for that like if they're all talking about the same narrative I'm pretty sure it's kind of so you're just looking for a pattern like what is

00:20:03	everybody talking about right now and you're looking at Nova to see what coins coming out and just like it's like just like ready to click so perfect example is um when Doge so the owner of Doge some you know lady Asian lady she got another dog what do you think is happening there oh my God it's Doge 2.0 you know cuz Doge died rip kabuso um and and this do this dog was called Nero now I'm looking at all these chats everyone's talking about Nero that's the name this Nero coin goes from zero to like hundreds of millions right there

00:20:36	and that like fed the entire trenches I that's like a generational coin PVE everyone ate everyone people retired and then we just had the biggest one ever Trump coin you know we saw Trump as soon as it came out that was crazy that fed the trenches like I mean people were tired I'm you're laughing but I'm serious and and I didn't buy it I actually I saw your tweets RP bro major cope um it happens I just didn't think it was real it's so hard to think that that's real yeah I would agree I thought the same thing like I thought he got

00:21:11	hacked yeah even if he got hacked though it's not that big of a risk you're s like you're going to get hacked if you just buy the token no no no I just thought like I'm I'm going to lose money buying the token yeah yeah it's like a 20 minutes later there's gonna be like an announcement yeah but some of my friends you know retired like I have a friend that made almost $40 million on Trump that's so crazy bro and they actually like delete their account you never hear from them again actually he's

00:21:35	still trading every day but I I can't believe it I don't know why you're doing this Sim the dean in the blood so so when you're in all these groups like there's like actually like so let's use the the Dogecoin owner example yeah like that comes out does that come like how did you find out that she had a new dog she tweeted it she just like some like article in her native language I don't know if it's like Japanese or whatever so she does she know that her first dog was the Creator so she knows that she

00:22:00	created this did she launch the coin no so she just unbeknownst to the like she just like posted this wholesomely like I have a new dog rip my dog and so you're going to basically you're in these six chats and you see like on chat on the screen bottom left you see this lady's dog just died the founder of Doge the icon of Doge's dog just died she's got a new one this is gonna this could be a meme this could be a me and then you see chat chat on the top right saying Yep this is going to be the next big meme

00:22:27	you see two other points data and you're like okay I need to go then go to Nova and be like this there's something here let's see if there's a token what happens if there's four tokens okay that's actually super common that's what we call PVP and this specific token was what invented PVP because there were so many different neros which is the name of the dog that were running that were doing good and this is the first token that ever created P I mean it just matters honestly who's behind the token

00:22:55	like what cabal is in right it matters which one was the first one which one's got the best picture and name I think nowadays we're we're kind of more accustomed to just buy the first one okay so but those are interesting variables one you say the cabal so like what group of 20 or 30 people in a telegram or Twitter DM that have maybe the most influence on Twitter combined they're not necessarily the creators but like they like have the most they're the cabal bro this a real thing I mean they have the power behind it to get the

00:23:24	initial liquidity it's like it's like like whatever like establish itself as the leader becomes a leader and so being first is an advantage having the most influence the most K's behind it is an advantage cuz there's going to have 10x more liquidity in the coin or the quality of the photo the description the name it's clean the ticker whatever it is exacts the vi is right exactly you got to think like which one of these can get listed on coinbase and binance so usually yeah it's interesting there's

00:23:53	like te there's probably like teams of people that are like launching coins and they have this like Playbook down I mean yes is that legal to do like I've always I don't think anyone knows I don't know I guess everything's legal now at this presidency me Trump made a meme coin so we should make one right now that's he does have the power to pardon I guess but not Financial advice we have to say those in these conversations don't we so that is very fascinating so you kind of just like are trying to see this meme come to life and

00:24:23	see it across different groups of people who are like in the trenches and these people have a lot of liquidity so like you know they can move the needle are there any groups you'd recommend being in other than potion Alpha on wap.com I can only show potion Alpha on wap.com okay potion off on wap.com endorsed but then like these telegram groups I remember this is something that you kind of have to like build up your crew over oh yeah people ask me this all the time like how do I even because yeah

00:24:48	you can join potion you can join these paid groups but then you're still not finding your mojo like your close-nit group of friends like how do you get into these telegram group chats and that's personal brand comes in bro like you want to get into these good group chats and prove yourself as a Trader go on these leaderboards and grind your way up and meet people be nice to people I mean there's a kid polar who's like 16 and a few months ago he had H like hit me up non-stop I gave him one Soul he

00:25:14	lost it all and he just hit like a million dollar a month a few months ago it is such a Vibe man you're just like you and your like five friends chilling in a voice chat all day trying to do the same thing like playing fortnite bro you're just like playing squads yeah and you're just literally like just sharing information like oh I saw this on Twitter you're looking at six chat he's looking at six different chats correct correct you're communicating each other like you're calling out someone's to

00:25:34	your left correct yeah that's so interesting and like there's like thousands of people trying to do the same thing in hopes of like thousands of other people like on CT seeing it one CT sees it like okay are they going to go on board like retail like this like an endless cycle exactly so there's like layers it's like first it's in your telegram or Discord group of like 20 people we're the first right like anyone watching pump fun is first yes it's like and then in the you go you explain it yeah and then it's like okay anyone like

00:26:01	for example like right now after this podcast I'm going to go to my telegram group chat see if I missed anything you know it's been two hours bro yeah it's been two hours like maybe Trump got a C you know I'm going to top blast this so like then comes like the the people who are going to buy after this French has found it and then you know people are going to start talking about it on Twitter and then people are going to start talking about it on regular social media and then how big does it get are

00:26:22	they going to start listing it on coinbase and binance are they going to talk about it on the news yeah so that's the level it's telegram then like Discord then crypto Twitter of Traders and then broader Twitter and then from there it could go mainstream mainstream or die or die it could go to the New York Times is like the very last level of this yeah I mean interesting I mean bro I don't think there is the last level because I thought that on Pina I was like how much bigger can Pina get and then we had Trump endorsing the

00:26:48	[ __ ] squirrel like this mascot of patri celebrities like the Final Exit liquidity that's you know you're at the top yeah celebrities is like a pretty good indicator so go like Twitter then you go like Tik Tok Instagram or whatever and then it would go mainstream media don't you remember like CH guy yeah of course okay iconic now all those trenchers thing super on in on chill guy and then it got to like this Tik Tok interesting so interesting I'm starting to understand the game are there any other like strategies you mentioned

00:27:15	sniping you mentioned paying attention to Nova what signals are happening inside of like like what is potion Alpha like actually half I mean pretty much everything right like let's say you don't want to be looking at the trenches all day cuz bro is like exhausting physically and mentally you know you can have like all these different tools open to kind of help alleviate the job for you you have your water trackers open and if you see you know the same good people you know copsy cooker whatever buying the same token take a look at the

00:27:42	token um same thing with like tracking Twitter like just leave it open on the screen or there's so many different tools bro like alerts that like certain coins hitting certain market caps you can set your own alert like you want to get alerted whenever a coin hits a mill market cap okay so anytime new coin from pump fun or whatever hits a million you get a notification yeah I mean you can really set whatever you want you can yeah and okay so this is a lot like back in the day but tools were really

00:28:08	rudimentary so hit this market cap signal these five wallets who I know are really good traders who have been known for getting early signal Twitter feed if someone mentions a meme signal y big person Elon Musk tweet signal and you're sitting there like hearing all these pings and just trying to process and see the correlations and that's your Edge essentially uh you know sometimes there's a Dev wallet that made a really good coin like the same Dev that deployed mudang maybe deployed another coin we have a signal for that the

00:28:37	um maybe we're seeing the same coin being deployed 10 times in a row maybe there's a hype launch about to happen signal um what else what else I'm trying to think of like everything we have in our Discord I think a lot of it is like mainly tracking social medias we track like true social for example that's where Trump initially posted the meme coin we're tracking certain Instagram posts certain Tik Tok pages um tracking how many times a hashtag gets used oh super big uh we're able to track if a Twitter profile has been

00:29:06	reused so like for example a lot of these people will like scam like there's a lot of like AI projects nowadays A lot of them will scam and then you know reuse the same Twitter page change the app uh and we can do like SL scam and it'll say that specific page has ever tweeted out a pump fun before um gotcha so people will buy Twitter accounts with like 100,000 followers on it change the url or change the handle change the profile Rebrand it and you're just making sure cuz if that's a that's a sign that if they've launched one coin

00:29:34	before they're just they're scammer because they're going to laun another and another and another lit that's their system that's so smart what other like things are there to look out for like that like or like straight up don't do um I mean obviously like I think following people on Twitter is very very important sometimes uh we actually potion built a Chrome extension to kind of give you um an idea of who like key people are so I follow 10,000 people on Twitter not cuz I want to but because when I go on a project I want to see

00:29:59	what my mutuals are that's super important if you're not following anyone on Twitter and you're going to like you know on crypto Twitter how there's a lot of like these like botted fake influencers right yeah if you're new to the space you go on someone's twitter they have 500k followers they tweeted out a CA has a thousand likes botted Comics but you can't tell you're going to buy and then they rug you yeah but if you're following like 10,000 of the most influential people on Twitter and this page of 500k has no mutuals now you know

00:30:27	it's not really legit you know mutuals are everything like basically when someone follows you on Twitter you can see who else they follow who else they follow and who else follows them like if people that your friends with follows them you kind of know they're a real person but these people will buy an account with 500,000 followers CA means contract address so like how like where you go basically the website to buy the token is the easiest way to explain it and so they'll tweet out these tokens

00:30:49	thinking that it's like some big person and so naive people just kind of buy that token and get and then the person who made the contract just takes all their money basically that's pretty much it rug pool yeah it's a tried and true method these days unfortunately so is there anything else that you could think of on the top of your head that are like like what's like what's like The Meta right now like this is right now today what day is it January 27th I'll post this in three days so what is the meta

00:31:15	for January 27th now we're still kind of like on this like AI type of thing like like the truth terminal stuff or well truth terminal started this whole new Niche it's not even a meta anymore it's just like a whole new category of coins now ai coins there's a projects you know really building on Solana really raising funds on with meme coins so a lot of it is still AI meta I'm not really good at it I've never traded AI meta I'm a news Trader I just made a few hundred thousand dollars on one trade like two

00:31:42	days ago um you know Larry he was on a podcast or not a podcast on the news and he was like talking about this coin called sorin coin the the news anchor asked him what do you think about meme coins and Ryan storin I think was his name Larry Fink says you know know there should be a sorin coin rather once that broadcast got posted out you know so the Black Rock CEO says to Andrew sorin like one of the biggest news anchors there should his last there should be a sorin coin that's all he said that's all he

00:32:12	said and there was five coins that came out there a coin I got it in at like sub 1 mil it went to like 30 mil how do you know when to sell how do you know when to sell oh I mean you don't know when to sell right it's just like how much you don't know I thought storing coin was going to 100 Mil I actually ended up roundt tripping a lot more that I made so you don't know it's just a how much attention can it get I thought Sor and coin could get a lot of [ __ ] attention but what was the time gap between that was that a live video or

00:32:40	was it posted somewhere it was posted I saw it an hour late my friend texted to me look at this uh I was an hour late it was already like above a m Mark cap and above a m I feel like I'm late because think about this if it goes from 1 mil to 10 mil that's a 10x right but it takes a lot to get to 10 mil so how much size do I need to put in to get a 10x rather than if I got in at you know 20K 30k 40K when it came out and then it hit a mill I made way more X's so I had to size in like almost you know $30,000 at

00:33:12	around a mill that's a lot right that's a big risk I'm taking which is why I don't like doing that but I thought the narrative was so good that I took the risk and there wasn't an OG it was like the first coin and eventually The Narrative got spread that's it it's literally like you're buying a ention units yes like if you could create a token for attention and for every unit of someone's attention for every second these are combining how much the coin is worth it's very interesting and sometimes you're really early I mean an

00:33:40	hour went by and sing coin wasn't at 10 mil yet like I thought I was so early and I was there's something about how this extrapolates into the attention economy as a whole like we already know Tik Tok and all Facebook and like Instagram all monetize our eyeballs like I feel like this is like actually going to be a transactional unit sometime in the next 20 years or something I don't know get prettyy dystopian but interesting concept to think about so it was an hour after the video came out yep that you saw that yes interesting I I

00:34:08	was going to ask you are you using so Nova is the exchange are you using a phantom wallet like what wallets everyone uses Phantom it's like the only wallet really right now okay so if you want to do this you need a phantom wallet you need to buy salana you got to buy salana on coinbase or Kraken sign it to Phantom from Phantom you're going to sign up on Nova and then yeah yeah so it's make exchange from coinbase or Kraken put US dollars in exchange for salana send that to a phantom wallet which is like a Chrome extension and

00:34:35	then connect that wallet to Nova or they can watch an orange you video and I'll show you how to do it easy you're trusted onboarding specialist right here okay so but are there any other like straight up don't does in the space actually how much are you paying I real quick question how much are you putting into each meme coin and how do you decide that you're right just depends how big the narrative can get like soring coin I decided to put in 30k which is oh my God 30k yeah you went big I did go that's very big I never go over

00:35:06	I try to stay you know around like 5 to 10 Soul when I'm first getting in and if I really got a size in like 2050 soul but yeah I mean 30k 150 Soul Souls around a little over 200 right now it's 230 right now 230 okay wow so you're usually putting in like a th000 to $2,000 on a safe bet but if you like have conviction and something you'll go up to yeah pretty much 20 30 yeah insane bro because this is like definitely like I also lose a lot by the way like yeah yeah that's that's why it's like I call

00:35:34	it's like gambling but when you think of gambling at like cinos it's like the OD are like usually 50/50 or like 48 52 or maybe it'll go 4060 but like these are like 9010 but like if you hit that 10 you make like 100x so it's like just extreme yeah I lose a lot but I lose uh I lose a lot of times but I don't lose a lot of money cuz I'm in so early that the max I can lose is so little what what how many times if you get into one and it's like not a winner are you just writing that to zero or no [ __ ] no super

00:36:04	you have stop louses or like you can look at my wallet on chain like 20 30 40% Max stop loss the only times I've ever lost all of my money is when I get rug pulled gotcha like when it's actually like a bad actor yes is there any way to diff like can you track on when someone's launching a pump fun you can track who's launching it yes the wallet yeah and you can check if like if if they're holding a lot of Supply on different coins it's another tool we have in potion like bundling is what so who launched it how much they have is it

00:36:35	important how many of the coins they got from that contract or you mean other coins in general like if they're like this person has $100 million in yeah sometimes that's important that could definitely be a factor of why a coin runs yeah so it's if the dev is a billionaire that's bullish that is bullish because they're not going to sell at the end of the day a lot of the nft projects they sell though sometimes but yeah but I mean like pudy penguins is so strong because all the people who have it are so rich now that they're not

00:36:57	going to sell it hun cake that might be nothing to them right like that's like a big part of to the Moon Yeah pangu to the Moon shout out Luca but I will say that's very so then one is how much money he has but do you pay attention to how much so when they launch a pump fund do they choose where the like do they get to choose how many tokens they get M and so you're just paying attention like did this person give themselves 90% of the supply course if they and sometimes they do it on different wallets and if

00:37:20	they're really good at it you can't even tell damn what okay so what's like I would love to know like what would be like we're going to leave the ethics side of like launching a coin and that being like legal or illegal like from a Trader's perspective what do you want to see in someone who's launching a coin for you to be like that guy is like doing things the right way it depends like am I investing into there's two different types of meme coins the meme coin that does not require the person who made it to be in it like a

00:37:45	news-based event like a moodang coin that doesn't need anybody but but sorry but you need to see how many coins they gave themselves sure but like most of the time we don't get a lot of like people giving themselves too much of a narrative coin at least on their main wallet um so there's the coins that don't need the dev and then there's the coins where it doesn't need the dev like if a coin has a whole website social media page right like if it actually has features where it needs the team behind

00:38:13	it and then that team sells like yeah that coin is going to zero but a a meme coin like mudang or whatever doesn't need anyone behind it it's a cultural thing interesting so you're not really doing too much analysis on the actual launch barely I only really buy things that do not need a Dev like s coin doesn't matter who made it sorry I'm getting so hung up on this but even if they don't need a Dev and it's being launched on pump fund does pump fund launch with a standard set or they could literally send themselves 99% of the

00:38:42	they can send themselves 99% okay is there like just a quick number you see like yeah you can like choose how much you buy gotcha but you would only be able to buy okay I see I see I see you can buy up to 80% of a whole token yeah yourself but it could just be straight from the guy okay I see I see no like when you're when you make a token on pump fun you can choose how much you want to buy you can buy up to 80% of it gotcha so I've been seeing on Twitter this week okay Aidan Ross getting into this these other big people getting into

00:39:09	this so last night Aiden Ross tweeted out that you know he wants to get into meme coins and there were so many different Aden Ross tokens being created and the people were buying 80% of the token to send to Aiden Ross because imagine Aiden had a public Solon wallet they would send they would send him 80% and then that coin whoever did it first would Skyrocket and that other 20% they get it on like alt wallets and then they bag out 80% of a coin cost 36 Soul you're spending like almost around 10

00:39:40	grand less than that 2 cent eight and 80% and imagine when it pumps like this happened so many times with like big streamers right they open up their Phantom wallet they see millions of dollars and it's like 80% token they own that they'll never actually be able to sell for cuz there's not enough liquidity to take out millions of dollars but it just looks good and like everyone else just bags off of them yeah I guess that's important to say like if you sent someone 80% of the supply and that's worth like $10 million there has to be

00:40:07	someone buying that and if even they sold one or two million of that that would t no they can't I mean yeah like you literally couldn't yeah it's impossible I saw Banks tweeting like he's helping onboard these people the right way yep what does that mean I think it's true I mean you know Banks lives with uh a lot of like other big you know people in the space so I think it's bullish no I know but like what is when he says he's going to onboard them the right way like well bro a lot of like these [ __ ] celebrities

00:40:35	and influencers just like Drop coins drop wallets you know the whole Haka thing yeah correct exactly like hakua didn't do anything wrong she just had the wrong people around her that's really all it is that's what it is most of the time Banks knows what he's doing I'm glad he's the one onboarding yeah that was pretty like the team that was like making a foundation and like pretending like this is going to be some big thing and it's like dude just let it be a meme like try not to take and I mean they I mean hakua she could launch

00:41:00	a coin herself with like a publicly vested schedule of how much she was going to sell throughout the next three months and made a lot more money and no headache so that's so that's the right way to do it I mean not Financial advice but I mean yes like but so like you're supposed to say that you own 20% of the tokens it's vested for three months meaning you can't sell any of them for at least three months and then once that after three months you can sell 10% every single month or something yeah I

00:41:25	mean this is like a regular thing that happens yes so it's just like being transparent with how you being transparent on what you're going to sell what you're going to do and how that will work when it does happen instead of just like taking all the money whenever you feel like it yeah bro I mean the team that launched that coin didn't do it in a good way they uh said exactly what time it was launching at they posted the CA before it got minted I mean what do you think happened bro it was a snipe Warfare so announcing when

00:41:48	it's going to happen and 400 pm. Eastern they had the ca it was literally a gas war in like Fe so everyone's burning money cuz the well is even salana has that high of fees now if it's like sniper war like that I mean you're competing it's like who can who's going to pay the most fee uh because if you so you basically set how much you're willing to pay and the more you're willing to pay the that's prioriti that prioritizes your transaction and if you're the first one you get like 10% of the supply for like pennies correct but

00:42:16	now the price is going into the transaction fee to get that allocated spot it's cool it's interesting so I'm so curious then are like these streamers aren't going to launch their own coins I'm assuming like do you if you're a famous person like her do you are you supposed to launch your own coin and be the owner of the the meme or are they just trying to like trade and participate man uh there's this one guy who did it really well Mike o'n you know who that is Big Jim Ander like one of the biggest I

00:42:48	think he instead of launching his own coin was hyping up meme coins and he just ended up Shilling Giga Giga Chad it's like a gym cultural coin at hundreds of millions and I'm sure he got paid a bag and I mean all they want is a bag like I have so many streamers influencers celebrities in my DMs every day yo put me on it seems really like I the reason I stepped away from crypto fully transparency is because it's like impossible to like win from the like from like literally from like the public opinion like people are like brutal they

00:43:19	all have like different goal posts I'm like what you're supposed to do what you aren't supposed to do I mean the goal post keeps going higher too that's like my main thing as well it's like I mean does it ever stop I think like crypto sets a really bad like precedent of like how much money is actually money and all this so that was like your whole trading career this is like the game that you've mastered kind of why you're known but in this time like three years ago in the bear everything like these tools weren't

00:43:43	as publicly available so you were kind of building these for yourself I built these like um a few months ago okay okay yeah this is brand new to me so you were you just like using like oneoff tools yes and you're like I should just like kind of make these same tools all in one place and then make a community potion started is I was spending like 5K a month on tools um and I was like I don't need to do this I'm like pretty known to space I'm sure I can just like put all the tools in one Discord and like make

00:44:08	other people pay for it uh and eventually that's what happened it was just tools like there was like one chat potion was just a [ __ ] ton of tools with one General chat and some voice chat so people can like use the tools with each other and learn about them and it just grew every day we got more and more people in The Voice chats and I'm like damn I'm gonna double down this and potion you know became like an actual now informative Alpha chat with um actual software behind it you know we have like fastest water tracker on chain

00:44:36	Chrome extensions uh public leaderboards like a whole the whole nine yards public leaderboards for your internal group yeah so we um through our water tracker we've added like a leaderboard system where you can like see who the best Traders are every single day and there were uh there's a competitor but like they would pick and choose who gets added to that leaderboard I wanted to make it we like hey anyone can go on their seeder board and like make a name for yourself if you want to join a good

00:45:01	group like make a name for yourself so yeah we're working like a ton of different features right now and developing more tools every single day uh we have an office you know 20 uh your is sick yeah thank you it's like 20 30 employees it's not like the [ __ ] headquarters but we're getting there in due time this is year worth three years in so yeah you have a little more time but your progress is great and everyone loves what you've built like actually like you have a positive reputation champ was speaking so highly of you

00:45:30	which is why I decided to like reach out to you like I was like I want to do one meme coins are hot I want to do one conversation with one person who should I talk to he said you so I sent you the DM I'm very curious with as this business develops like how are you like getting it like how are people hearing about it cuz I know you have a YouTube channel but that seems relatively new no um I mean I've been doing YouTube for a long time right like yeah my this Niche right now is new but I've been doing

00:45:56	YouTube for you know 10 11 years I've oh what really yeah bro I mean I blew up on fortnite right I had a big fortnite Channel with 100K Subs millions of views oh okay I was a big twitch streamer thousands of views averaged and then I did also the whole entrepreneur nich Niche bro I've done SM Snapchat shows YouTube proo come on everyone that you've interviewed I I mean I've I've done so much business with um I've tried the whole nine yards and like this is the one thing that stuck you know I did

00:46:23	smma scale it to 20K a month I did Snapchat shows I did YouTube shorts I worked with not look I did fortnite Maps oh okay cool I've done the whole nine yards that's sick Bro I didn't know that part I I knew you were a fortnite player so I assumed you knew Luke I all these entrepreneurs like came from fortnite me and not looke were on the same team we were like you know now he was killing it with YouTube you know crayo all of them wow so you did you were you in the crypto cycle last year yeah yeah 2021 yes but you were a

00:46:53	professional fortnite player I was still playing fortnite back then yeah um I made some decent money in nfts but I lost it all I went from like very very unrealized uh High six figes to 40K in dead like I had nothing yeah and after like inflating my lifestyle and all this I was like damn I got to lock in so that's when I decided to invest myself I did like I bought Iman gazi's smma course uh I did Tom Cruz's Section 8 real estate course I did uh you know whole bunch of different programs in courses until like something stuck smma

00:47:23	got me out of the out of the loophole and then like some other lore to add in 2023 you remember dooky Dash mhm bour a posted a gaming competition I went back to my gaming routes I made $600,000 playing a video game in two months and you you won I got third third yes I did not win mongra won fornite player he made 2.2 mil what what did I forgot what was it nfts or AP coin what was it was it yeah so they were giving out these heavy metal nfts um and people were just paying to like get like the best score

00:47:51	you know it doesn't make a lot of sense now that I think about it but yeah that's so interesting but 600k that's a bag that's bailed me out like I I made so many connections I made a real name for myself in crypto that's how it started I made a name for myself in crypto because I used my gaming skills for like this web 3 gaming thing it's always so interesting to think about all the competitive Esports players because you have like Fast problem solving you learn the game faster than anybody else like it

00:48:16	actually is just showing like how quick you can think how quick you can make decisions how you can learn and make like problem solving yeah and now it's all applying to crypto for all of you guys and business exactly that yeah so do you think the estim all the what did do you think you've lot like learned much from those courses like do you think those helped you a lot um to be honest no I think the main value I've gotten out of courses uh has been the people I've met until one stuck though I paid $30,000 to Jordan Welch back in

00:48:41	September and my YouTube went from like zero subscribers to 100K now and my business potion went from 17K a month to you know a lot more like yeah I've heard a lot of people out of Jordan's program are doing really well that you know there's always like courses programs some people see it as like Guru it's cringe but it's like you keep trying until one of them works out yeah yeah YouTube there's a very specific methodology to titles thumbnails hooks like very specific that if you just pattern match and learn like

00:49:13	it's pretty repeatable but you need a lot of GE in the game to get that intuition you do so like I wanted to pay someone for that you you paid the best and now I pay Jordan who's really good at what he does not only did I get my YouTube up but I got that relationship and connection with Jordan and you know Jordan's introduced me to other people and it's kind of pro and you were with with FaZe Banks last week I was with FaZe Banks last week because it's you know pretty much Jordan watch let me there but yeah it's all so just all

00:49:37	proliferates that way that's interesting so do you think that even because then potions new yes so you probably learned the business skills at least somewhat from that yeah I mean I learned a [ __ ] ton of business skills from failing over and over again bro I've done so much I started some AI software company last year or two years ago that did not go well at all I BR like 20K doing that when was still a lot of money 20K is still a lot of money um yeah I've just done so much [ __ ] over and over again interesting bro

00:50:05	so do you think that what is like the what does your YouTube channel mainly focus on just like right now it's uh it's been educational crypto content we just released our first Vlog yesterday and it's a one of 10 by far of my two of 10 video that got 200k views so I'm thinking like damn this video might get like couple 100K VI going to pop that's that's addicting bro the one out of 10 on YouTube dude and like it's personal brand it's vog it's like what I want to do for the rest of my life I don't want

00:50:29	to be in front of a computer the rest of my life I want to be you know a Creator like you'll have multiple phes just like fortnite this is your crypto era you're going to have a ton of different ways and this will stick with you I want the personal brand era yeah keep it pure bro it's cool I'm curious then do you think that a crypto group a lot of my friends have crypto groups do you think that's like a like I'm always curious like it's like what do you do you have to be qualified to like sell a crypto group

00:50:53	like yeah I would probably assume so I think uh one of the main things that helps me out is like obviously I've proved myself like on chain like people can go and see I've made millions of dollars trading um but yeah I mean like like the most important thing is like you don't want it to just be a group where people are going in for Alpha because once your Alpha gets bad your business goes to [ __ ] right like once we go into a Bear Once We whatever the case may be where like the information you're putting out

00:51:18	isn't good anymore all your like your user retention your turn is just going to like die um so we're trying to build like actual sustainable software that are going to use every day even throughout a bare market and that's going to be like our path to setting the company one day like actual tools especially for the trenchers who are usually stick around there's always going to be new tenters coming in and I mean I want to monopolize like all of crypto like can I build a product where people know potion not just orangey

00:51:44	because right now we have like this huge keyman risk where like hey orangey is potion but like eventually potion would just be potion yeah the personal brand attached to the act the face attached to the company and the company need to be its own thing Prime KSI log Paul yeah prime prime interesting dude if someone wants to like I'm just other other paths to making money in crypto than just trading meme coins that you would see like you obviously trade first then you had some money that funded what you've

00:52:09	built now I mean trading nfts airdrop farming yeah that's pretty much it are you going to airdrop Farm the abstract launch I am a big pengu holder so I think I'm just collect my air drop yeah yeah if I was thinking about they just did like the abstract live streaming stuff yeah you applied yeah I applied I'm assuming that if you live stream on that that's what qualifies you I don't know I don't know I'll just like I I I moping my penu bags get me air a lot I have a lot in penu too much probably

00:52:38	shout out to Luka for giving all the OG holders an air drop for that that's awesome so what else do you think is like that's what I was I want to go back to the topic of like FaZe Banks bringing all these people into crypto yeah like do you recommend like if like would you like if there's a 16-year-old kid in front of you right now would you tell him like like and he wants to make 10K a month or he wants to make $10,000 would you look him in the eyes and be like get in the trenches this is what you should

00:53:03	be doing if I was helping him out like if he was going to come under my wing yes but you it's a one-off conversation you're never going to see him again [ __ ] dude I don't know bro because like people lose a lot of money when they start you got to pay your tuition fee and sometimes your tuition can be like a lot of money um if if I was like I probably bro I do think the opportunity to make money here is like endless I thought this [ __ ] was going to end a long time ago I thought when I started

00:53:27	in April I was going to have till the summer I thought when summer was over all right maybe until the election now it looks like crypto's [ __ ] mainstream this [ __ ] might never end I think mean coins might stay forever like how sports betting is completely normal now I think eventually like every Market will just be monetized I think for the rest of our lives any big news event will be put on chain do you think that that makes a lot of sense that's what I'm saying like these attention units like as a whole like that seems like

00:53:52	something that could actually have some legs to it do you ever do you get interested in like game AI or gaming crypto or like I'm me interested in gaming crypto not AI though do you know what are the are there any good games that have like launched that have tokens is Off the Grid doing well I don't like Off the Grid personally but people do that's a crypto Tok like game with nfts right yes are there any other game is there a game that you're like looking forward to that you think will do well or you think the traditional ones just

00:54:16	need to implement it probably not yet I think traditional ones will have to implement it I do think like gaming and crypto eventually are going to intertwine and you're going to have like GTA 6 have a organic token native token uh to control their entire ecosystem it'll happen eventually uh I think for right now there's no game I'm super looking forward to I enjoyed playing like dooky Dash and like uh farana I don't know nothing too much back in the day yeah who are the best sources of information for meme coins right now

00:54:43	like who do you like like who do you like really respect or like listening to keep up with what just like like who are your favorite people to follow and like why I mean obviously like good Traders um as far as information there one guy melow metric he gives out like these daily Recaps of everything that goes on in the trenches I think if you're just like starting to like get into this you follow Melo you go read his daily recap every day understand why those coins blew up every day and eventually you'll

00:55:08	get a hang of it where his daily Recaps at on his X page it's mellow m e l l o metric interesting and then do you like are streamers getting into crypto right now is like a big thing yeah I mean there's streamers that pull thousands of views streaming the trenches every day trading I want to hear stories of like what's been going on like what have been like the most like interesting things that have happened in the last like three six four months in crypto I mean we've had all sorts of celebrities launch their

00:55:38	cryptos we have tjr and toi you know streaming the trenches we have Andre Tate pumping every single coin on stream uh and we have [ __ ] Trump making a coin we have rumors of Baron making 10 different coins which might be true um I mean bro what Happ hasn't there been like I think everyone knows about me coins at this point is there a narrative that you're like excited for or something that you're working on that you're excited about um a narrative I'm excited for no not really whatever just comes comes Elon get a pet that's like

00:56:09	the most PVE narrative that could happen right now get a pet get a pet any pet what does PVE mean what do you mean PVE Nar people versus environment it's like basically right now the trenches are super PVP like it's player versus player we're fighting against each other if we get a narrative like that it's not it's just like trenches versus retail that's what is and what but what does it mean to get a pet like if Elon mus got an animal that is like the best actually if he gets a pet so you're just like on the

00:56:37	edge of your seat every day to see if he makes a Twitter of him getting or a tweet of him getting a dog or an X post of him getting a dog that's like a phenomenal narrative early and then he's like [ __ ] it making a meme coin oh my God that would go crazy what if that happened right now that's like another thing right I'm 24/7 on my phone always looking and I miss a lot of plays I'm at home like even right now bro that could actually have just happened it's an opportunity cost bro this could have been $100,000

00:56:59	conversation if Elon dropped got a dog it'd be multiple millions of a conversation but yeah what other opportunities are like that Elon getting a pet I mean bro there's always something I mean it could be like an article or like a new catch phrase like all right when Trump won the election and he got he got inaugurated the new catch phrase is America is back uh I went to x.com Pootis when the podus handle Got Hand handed over to Donald Trump and I saw his Banner said America is back the first aib coin I saw I

00:57:31	bought and then you know after the inauguration was done they tweeted America is back it's this whole new slogan this whole new like cultural phenomenon got created around this coin and I made a lot of money on that so just like culture it's like being tapped in with culture yeah and then it's being online and seeing if it's picking up steam did you I mean do you remember the the recent Elon Musk meme that he did at the inauguration that was a big meme coin very big talking about his his heart goes out yeah that one correct it

00:57:59	was called itler Elon and Hitler and that coin went to multiple Mills I made a lot of money on that coin how do you know that it's going to be like how do you like that moment happens how do you know that's going to be the ticker I didn't know that that was going to be a ticker there was a lot of tickers but that was the one that was like gain the most attraction and you know good ticker so I just ended up top blasting and making a lot so when you see something like that are you like saving like like

00:58:19	if it's like you're seeing like 20 coins come out seven of them are related to this and you're like sa so how it works is you have three tabs in front of you on this trading platform like Nova mhm and you have other the new coins the ones that are about to hit the radium liquidity pool and the ones that already have hit the radium liquidity pool right what does that mean radium liquidity pool when you make when you make a token on pump f it has to reach a certain market cap depending what the price

00:58:37	salana is let's say 100K it has to hit 100K market cap for it to actually get put onto like normal radium so that you can buy on Phantom so that you can like a normal token radium is the salana liquidity pool basically um correct me if I'm wrong I don't know but something like that we're getting technical sorry and uh yeah like on those two tabs you can see like there's like 10 different tokens that are about to hit the liquidity pool and they're all like these different ones and one of those is

00:59:03	the one that's going to go when it hits a liquidity pool what happens it like kind of just stays what do you mean when it's going to the liquidity pool it's just like frozen you can't buy yourself for like a good two three minutes gotcha and then it hits the actual liquidity pool anyone can buy the token can go there's no more max market cap of 100K it's just infinitely up or down interesting okay so then was that one that you need to like like is there like an intuition there you were like this is going to be a meme

00:59:30	or was there like external signal so obvious like Elon just [ __ ] he's got to be looking for it at the end of the day bro like that's such an obvious meme obviously it's going to be put on Tik Tok Instagram like who isn't going to talk about that it's like any moment that happens that's it like I mean that's really it you're just playing the game of how viral can this moment go how viral can X Y and Z go and once you think you have one then it's identifying out of all the tokens they're launching

00:59:53	the which is the best or sometimes you buy all of them brother genuinely yeah yeah interesting and it's just as simple as that you're going to be online 24/7 that's the game that is the game bro that's it I actually feel like I understand I can do it pretty well right now it's not that hard I I inition you have to build that's really it yeah you're just going to be like confused because there's so many coins coming out but like you could just play the news game like being early to the Tik Tok Trend like even a saying you know how

01:00:19	people start saying like the huzz mhm like the huz coin went to like 20 mil you know like just stuff like that so if it's like a new slang skib all the stuff basically skib toilet memes at like 100 Mil like staying flatlining yeah what what okay what gives a meme legs like that uh Community culture how viral is it really like harambe is still a famous meme yeah yeah I mean like Sheba do are like huge those are like iconico yeah yeah so I don't know I don't really hold things longterm I'm playing like the

01:00:48	quick attention game my only longterm bag of meme coins is like Brett penu Loy it's about it is Brett on bass Brett is on base yeah are there any other bass ones why did that one stick I never understood that crash uh like the KO behind it it was a famous person basically interesting is there like marketing like if like if you saw a coin launched and they had like a specific marketing strategy that they posted would that like get you to hold longer like what would make you hold longer it could be but again I I like to

01:01:19	trade news only that's just your style and you just know your I just feel like I have a really good Edge at knowing how viral L can get and you probably too I mean you're good at this marketing [ __ ] so for sure bro so that's like what it is though like just you know your Edge is news and this is how you my Edge is not AI tokens but my friend's Edge is strictly AI they know how to read GitHub they know how to like do all this stuff like they're always checking like the LinkedIn pages of the founders and

01:01:44	seeing all these AI companies they worked at prior and like actually so just building The Narrative of the team behind itre everything interesting could you explain the truth terminal stuff to me CU I I don't know too much about it it's started AI metas um you know this Dev Andy created an AI Twitter called Truth terminal um truth terminal created a meme coin or actually no he created a cult-like religion called goat cus Maximus he's like there should be a religion called goat sees Maximus so somebody made a token called goat and

01:02:16	then they were like hey trueth terminal give me your wallet and they sent him a lot of supply of goat coin and Truth terminal started supporting the goat coin the goat culture the goat CS ma religion and uh it just infinitely went up and then I think it's um I forgot this guy's name Mark Mark andreon someone like that someone really big Andre Horwitz yeah I don't know someone and Mar I don't know someone really big probably different uh he funded he gave goat the AI a million dollars so like now you have like this big ass VC AI you

01:02:49	know a16z person um I think he's like the CEO of A6 yeah yeah Mark andreon yeah yeah oh yeah him him he's fing this truth terminal and it just rips two billions of dollars Mark cap and it creates like a whole new AI so a random guy made a Twitter account that was controlled by like an llm like an AI yes and then so this Twitter account is just tweeted like by himself it's an AI tweeting yaen and then he created this religion then somebody decided to like how did he have a wallet how they thought it was funny how did the AI have

01:03:18	a wallet yeah well they well the Creator W it's a good question how the [ __ ] did the AI get the wallet people people I me we we'll never so a person is it even an AI yeah that's what I'm confused about so it's bro that happens all the time so we don't know if it's like an AI who then made a wallet and it's an AI tweeting than the actual Creator I believe Andy the dev of true terminal made it for him um does so but he doesn't touch the wallet or the AI the human bro he just sold like a million

01:03:45	dollars or way more of fcoin which is another big coin you've heard of fcoin so the AI isn't actually buying and selling the coins no not that my understanding no it's not that's what I thought it was I was like this is crazy no it is not thread guy is like going on Twitter every other day well he's also terrified of AI it seems like he's like saying that this is like the end of our existence every day it seems like yeah th th guy I love thre guy though he's he's a goat but yeah he's very bullish

01:04:10	on Goat he's got big bags in Goat hell yeah what is MOG MOG is a cultural phenomenon that you know a very early meme coin that was able to create a very cool culture around it k money was very early a lot of influential people who will hold with you cabal if you want to call it that decided you know MOG is this culture that should MOG and MOG is a great token how did Pepe do what they did Pepe I wasn't really super deep into it but I did buy super early I think Pepe is just like you know very big overall

01:04:43	Meme and I think the owner like the Creator I forgot his name what's his name the owner of the guy who drew Pepe [ __ ] I forgot I always buy his meme coins anyways I forgot he like ended up endorsing it or whatever and it just Skyrocket so the guy who actually made the actual ionic art to the meme yeah supported it what about MLG that was recent MLG that is recent um you know big people behind it and it's very cultural phenomenon that I'm holding Moji it's relatable bro you're holding it yeah I am I used to play game battles

01:05:13	all the time I was don't you relate to it a lot of our our our people anyone watching this knows what MOG is the the FaZe the hunter thieves the store gaming like the MW2 rust days optic gaming hex like it's very cultural so I I see how an MOG coin could go it has good people behind it but again like this is more long-term stuff like I'm not super focused on it I just hold MLG what is there like actually like is it related to the found MLG shut down no it's just a meme coin so it's just a meme coin and

01:05:41	they made like this one page or with The Branding yeah we can make a meme coin on wag Me podcast and it would just be it's not related to you at all but it's just like get any ideas not going to go Von do not do that please but I see I see that makes sense and then Banks just kind of tweeted it was like a good match from what I know you know Banks isn't involved whatsoever he actually just genuinely liked it and that's it yeah cuz I mean he's if there's a person to like it that's him yeah it makes a lot

01:06:04	of sense and so then I'm trying to think of all the other meme coins that I've like heard across Bonk what was Bon all about Bon is like an actual token though like they actually have software behind it but yeah it is technically a meme coin but they have a really big trading bot and all the fees and revenue from that trading bot are like used to like burn and buy this token pretty much so it's like all of these there's not like one thing that you're looking for it's like does it have like a cohesive

01:06:25	narrative that makes sense so like MLG was like everyone in the crypto space remembers game battles game battles was huge MLB is huge MLG is huge and then that resonated with banks who was like literally like the OG of MLG and I just hit mainstream yep okay then like this Kus required somebody like bangs to make it hit mainstream though like valid that's like a validation right that's the main issue is like yeah you can be super early to a good thesis you can but like if you can't get someone to push

01:06:55	this or if if the cabal doesn't pick it up on time you could be wasting something which is where you know being all these groups comes into play Because if you think something's not being caught right if that Ryan sorin coin for example no one was talking about it put it in 10 group chats I'm sure it will get spread eventually go so it has to just catch that traction be like there has to be like subjective consensus like everyone just has to like agree this is that's like the Hot Potato thing everyone just has to agree that this is

01:07:22	like legit and then everyone's attention's on that for a day and it's it's a game Hot Potato really get in get out I'm just curious why the ones that stick stick is like so some of the like pump fund isn't like a community based but some will actually have like a Discord Community with people that resonate with this message and have activities just get people to stick around and want to feel like they're part of it like it's all of them end up doing that that's what we call bag holders so uh that's what we in the

01:07:44	industry call yeah yeah I mean there every coin ends up getting a community but it's just like I know bro we're in a really fast-paced market right now where it's really hard to make something stick they can only stick if they have someone big behind it I think it it makes sense to me like there's actually there's a method to the madness I hope you learned a lot it's definitely gambling but there's a method to it and there's an edge because you're gambling into other humans and if you're faster

01:08:09	quicker deeper in the trenches yeah I mean imagine make money imagine like this actually did happen but like the New York mayor right they appoint like an animal I'm pretty sure that did happen something like a pig or whatever you know that would run I mean a mayor is an animal like it's just like basic stuff you had to have grown up on Tik Tok to get this [ __ ] man I feel like I'm like just at the edge of like understanding little old bra this is you have to have a PhD in brain rot but that is your Edge and if you do and if you're

01:08:36	online 24/7 you should get into meme coins you should get into meme coins I guess not Financial advice but it would make sense yeah like it has there is a method and I think that's what I came here to understand and I appreciate you sharing it brother of course D dude where can people find you on social media uh orangey on YouTube orangey on Twitter uh that's pretty much it to be honest all right guys this guy knows what he's doing if you want to get in the game this is the guy I asked all of my friends I was going to do one podcast

01:08:58	on Meme coins who I should have he was the unanimous vote check out orangie brother thank you so much

----------------
00:00:00	I made a brand new wallet and funded it with 15 Solana and I recorded the entire trench process all the dead times all the bad times and are the good times as well today you guys are going to see the raw unedited footage of all of these trades and I'm going to be breaking down my thought process of all of these trades explaining it to you guys and I hope this is the most useful video I've ever posted on this channel and it helps you on your journey to become a good fana meme coin Trader enjoy another

00:00:27	update on the coin tomorrow morning I don't know I feel like it could gain the like with this narrative bro it's literally like the cutest [ __ ] I didn't even hear what he said it's like the cutest Boomer ever yeah you heard he refers to bitcoin as unicorn Part D T jayen wants to smash the old dude I already posted my never heard this boy is like saying he's hot as [ __ ] you know he's like this guy's like he said look at this all right I wanted to include part into the video because that was the first trade that we took it was

00:01:03	a deriv play of ufd and I want to go ahead and talk about something you guys just heard my friends giving their thesis on ufd unicorn fart dust it was a very popular coin that came out just a few days ago it ran all the way up to 300 mil and when my friends were talking about it I mean they were getting entries all the way down here I want to go ahead and scroll here to the top Traders you guys just heard what the thesis were and two people in that call nim ended up making 242k realized already he has 200k left of the coin and

00:01:30	then J who was awesome the call made 150k and has 135k unrealized you guys are going to be hearing the thoughts and thesis of my friends on all these different coins that we will be trading in the video but that was the first trade that we took it was a deriv play of ufd which I think we ended up like losing or like making like pretty much nothing on it enjoy the rest of the video yo Kenzo what do you know about PFC yeah I just got this is like insane bro the coins at 22 mil it's Auto oh it is yeah the it's automated by Mana which

00:02:00	is at 22 mil I didn't get in enough bro I got in and they just quot tweeted the ca they just quot tweeted the ca yeah I know I saw that I asked csy I was like csy is this not good as [ __ ] and I saw you top holder I was like wait Ken's top holder in this I've talked about the importance of being in a call with other traders who are also trenching that might catch things that you may miss so often let's talk about what exactly is happening here so this coin just filled from pump fund it's about to hit the radium liquidity pool

00:02:30	and we're talking about what this coin is when you go on their Twitter you see that it was an automated AI Twitter account that was automated by a coin on Salon that's already at 22 mil so 22 mil market cap coin deploying another coin could be a farm could be a hack we don't know yet but nobody also you you got to like understand there's thousands of people who also don't know all the correct info on the coin yet so people are going to be willing to gamble and as you will see right now I start opening a

00:02:57	snipe to try to get a good TX using the NOA sniper bot and watch what happens I'm I'm up 30 I got in the pump fun [ __ ] I didn't get in I didn't get in enough yo K's a fat I didn't get in enough wow I'm I'm up 20 out of Mill GG's GG sus oh damn nice he's up good I'm like recording this [ __ ] CH [ __ ] he made like 20K on it yo are they I'm I don't I don't I think they are did you get in kimchi no cuz where the [ __ ] are you guys at cuz I know you guys were in the call I was just chilling with my girl oh

00:03:49	no you were not then why'd you ask because you you both join at the same time I can't join all right and after that trade that we made 17 St on on a sniped that we got a good feel on we made almost a 3X on our 10 Soul um you know you guys are watching a sped up version of just like an hour goes by of absolutely nothing and this is just kind of the truth of how it is most days you can be on for like 10 hours and nothing happens at all and then you can leave for like 1 hour and you have Elon Musk

00:04:18	tweeting a picture of a dog Trump tweeting a picture of a cat like so many unexpected things can happen which is why it's important to be on all day though maybe I'm just cooked how's yeah I'm [ __ ] rap it's been really good fed at [ __ ] two minut H can you put I put it in chat oh wow what was this like a political page in China that advocates for free speech made a coin to like fund all the [ __ ] made the coin yeah they deployed a car wait let me send a tweet hold up you guys cook on this yo what did ufd go to it's 82 mil

00:05:03	bro all time high oh wow not you held yeah I mean I look you papered but I held till like like 60 I start n is up fast like nft is online why did I just get filled that wait for a brother link for brother oh my God I'm a fat bro what the [ __ ] did is yeah I did I just wasn't sure if it was working or not I going to get rug I mean they played a whole video of how it works kind of like nfts or some [ __ ] you can send during like a link I pretty [ __ ] entry yeah I do too W are you a new wallet nope the hell I don't see

00:05:54	it like he bought like eight Soul oh I see yeah yeah damn you're up fat yeah I mean I didn't I wasn't sure if it was word I had to like do rech cuz it like the chart looks so weird like was L just only uh what are these things next to everyone's name on photon now trans transaction through a trading bot SL yo it's lowy mooning Waddles how much are you up like 100 dude what I have my initial I sold like a decent amount though no no just keep it on the browser yeah I just want to make sure like didn't rug but I mean the

00:06:36	Tech's working and it doesn't look like they're selling cuz I think they had some of the bundle cuz it was like all right so few things here so far we just saw a coin that spawned pretty high it seemed to have good tech on Twitter and we checked the holders the bundle whether or not they're already selling to do more research and then we actually connected our waterall to the site check if it was uh working stuff if you're ever going to do this by the way make sure you're connecting an ALT wallet on

00:06:59	salana so that they don't drain your main wallet if it's a scam and this next play you're about to see is a really good one it is a Twitter tracker play best types of play so that's his coin oh if it is it's going it's crazy oh my God profit backed out oh he's cooking uh yeah yeah who's dying he tweeted no you replied to a pump fun it's the one that you guys are in I think oh my I just got inst no no no why did I try did I try buying this [ __ ] I knew I was going well no it is this one I mean he

00:07:47	just saidd it is this one which one the one that internal SW twed uh so is that a buy and he said my Twitter tracker he said live wo let's redefine I don't know yeah he's like saying this is is basically yeah can he just tweet to C for this cat he tweet he Vis see keep eyes on the mission wag woof but this guy's like yapping that's definitely not this coin then what he said vision isn't pinned to a CA I guess not really confirmed BR us this one I don't think at least just getting [ __ ] bid so I mean he replied to it

00:08:38	though live yeah but yeah I don't I don't think if he keeps [ __ ] tweeting like different things [ __ ] oh cat's live I didn't even realize they didn't tweet see how just bought all another one the one two hours ago at 5 mil yeah they're saying what dude why yo why is why is it [ __ ] ripping bro cast 250 I don't [ __ ] know bro but it's I was about to sell bro all what the [ __ ] well I don't want to sell anything in case this is real cuz if it's if they post it on Tik Tok then it's going to go

00:09:15	Mills oh my god dude it's just only up it's looking like it's real wow this is a really good art it does I need to something because it's made it's made in that wallet has it two hours ago yeah 400k it says clearing Bots though don't buy it's like maybe they're maybe I don't know I didn't read the bio I just saw like another coin I was like oh [ __ ] oh they posted CA on Twitter yep yeah I don't know but I don't know if it's actually work does it what the hell just failed to catch token data it's probably not

00:10:12	his oh he put the Twitter on Tik Tok now as well oh he put on oh this was such a cook man if I help from start I'll be up [ __ ] so much yeah same a I thought it was why yeah I just knew that they these guys did it last time but they didn't have the AR he post on Tik Tok right yeah he put a Twitter M can go hard oh my God BR is only up bro wow damn bro I should have [ __ ] H my entire bag all right right there you saw me fumble play on cat I had a really good entry but I ended up selling it cuz I

00:10:54	wasn't sure if it was going to be true or false this is just the type of stuff that happens all the time on chain um this next play we saw a coin come out that was like AI generated big Tik Tok meme we had the Apple Dog coin that was also a AI generated Tik Tok meme go to like 50 mil so this is a pretty good d/ beta play and then there's actually some really good W start that start toping this but I end up round tripping a lot of it and you guys will see that now hey what coins made by the dev he made a Tik Tok for it yeah so if

00:11:24	you're in swing the only other thing that I found ticker now finally it's called pibble that's the other one p i b b l e I can send what's it at 210 [Music] people okay yeah I see that interesting wow what coin is this bro oh this has a Tik Tok made for it so I think yo nsh this guy added you too bro Timothy what he added you and me me on Dino all right so really big problem just happened now this coin has already been you know getting some wallets buying and we find out holy [ __ ] there's an OG but the OG doesn't have a Tik Tok

00:12:12	for it OG has a different name and you guys will kind of see what ends up happening here with this narrative on link is 1.2 mil bro God damn BR at this point coins at 500k put around some other discords cooker who's a really good Trader he's made over $10 mil plus and up toping the coins so at this point I'm like oh my God this could probably go Mills but the other taking all the volume and end up round tripping as you can see I'm up like 30 40 so here and that's not how it end going you guys have been spot on

00:12:39	with a lot of this mein culture early on bro early so a few things we could learn from here obviously I should have taken more profit uh should have been aware that the OG was pping the narrative I thought was better and obviously I wasted a lot of time as well because your time is valuable so think about it like this if you're looking to trench and trade these new pump funds you cannot be allocating your time towards being stuck on one coin that is not really just skyrocketing up because during the 30 minutes to an hour that

00:13:08	you spend staring at the chart because well we all know that's the truth of this [ __ ] you're just staring at charts hoping it goes up um you're wasting 30 minutes to an hour to two hours however long you may be in that coin emotionally attached to it where like you're really like oh you know I don't really want to be scanning other coins there's a million coins coming out at the same time and obviously I'm going to call my friends so if anything like super good comes out they'll call it out but for

00:13:30	somebody who may not be you know you need to be moving on pretty quickly from the majority of these coins as 99.9 of them end up at zero so right here a coin just spawned at like 2 million going all the way up 3 million 4 million 5 million I just buy into it without having time to do a lot of research and it looks really good so far so here you're watching me do some research this is just like only up challenge right now hello page 66 hold on I think it's damn bro I'm hella late to it low key someone

00:13:57	said page 66 I just on Twitter oh my God an individual just pumped off onto creative token called QBC what okay yeah what the actual top last season low key wow I have such a dog [ __ ] enter on this it's actually real too what the hell is the source real let me check my group chats yo qu is actually real dude yo it's LARP all right that is unfortunate all right anyways so yeah I mean right there I just made a mistake that cost me so much of my port folio let's go ahead and actually take a look at this play but I

00:14:32	mean I let's explain what the coin was so the SEC or whatever the US government had just tweeted out a new tax bill and it was like so many pages worth of it and obviously the files deleted now because it ended up being fake but this is a link to the profile I mean to the whole pages and there was a example of like what would be illegal in meme coins and it was like example if somebody made a quick Bo QuickBook quick Buck coin QBC on pump. fun uh the token would be rug pole whatever so people were like holy

00:15:02	[ __ ] the [ __ ] government is talking about pump fun and I was late I was a top Blaster this is one of those narratives that you catch by being early in Alpha chats but as you heard I wasn't locked in cuz I was actually busy on other stuff but River who is a part of you know some other groups they had caught this super super early and look it wasn't display where was it QBC right here they made 2 22k on my head because they were early to the narrative you see these wallets I we buying right here

00:15:35	this is before the narrative got spread around and if you guys are brand new to the game I've explained this many many times but this is how it works any coin with a decent narrative has to jump from person a right who is the trencher this is like the cupies whatever this person tells their friends like and their you know it's just like an infinite life cycle and it goes from group to group you know from potion to shock to pastel to CT to whatever so whoever gets the earliest entry which in this case was

00:16:04	River was able to make a absolute [ __ ] bag off of people that like like me you know and River didn't know it was fake I mean everybody thought it was real but but by the time people had finished doing their research this coin went instantly zero I mean we're talking about a 10 minute time a let's see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Minute time span here where you're getting all these crazy top blasts and I end up losing 27 Soul which was like a lot of what I had just made so this was the biggest setback so far in the challenge few

00:16:38	things here where I wasn't locked in on group chats right I was busy doing other stuff so I shouldn't have top lasted ative I got F mode into it because I thought holy [ __ ] this narrative is so good if it is real it is 100 Mil coin but I should have done some research before blasting in $114,000 which is a majority of my portfolio and I am lucky I was able to cut this [ __ ] quick 4% before cut your losses quick when you're locked in let's move on Ma yeah that's oh that's quite good actually yeah tweeted one minute ago as welll

00:17:19	earnings and Bitcoin dude College like the first nil deal first nil deal in like did that um did that player asked for his salary in uh Bitcoin or did he just like invest everything in Bitcoin yo fcoin on bitcoin wait yeah this actually good yes we were in one earlier but it didn't even like do anything or fill that [ __ ] had some much volume on it though I this good bro if it fills it can go yeah if if it fails well I just died quite a bit RT can we hold hold the OG hostage yeah I will hold on oh my God okay I'll will

00:24:12	the coin to 200 fill so there were two things all right here we go okay this is funny get ready I don't know if you saw this wait foot Bitcoin bubblegum uh is that what it's called yeah he has it listed on eBay yeah look look at the images see the only Bitcoin bubble that's already what it's called he's auctioning it on eBay yeah oh it says the only Bitcoin bubble oh [ __ ] picture yeah yeah and the third any other ones made no there wasn't any other ones made to you bbum came out as well what is bit this should be really

00:25:08	good it went to is thanit 4K it went to 400k yeah I know I actually think it's better as well and it's called this he has it literally listed on eBay assassin just bought some here hey W you got 10% bro oh do I actually oh [ __ ] caught up in a little bit of work right now govern yeah that's pretty good Z coin there was a um 20 there was a uh poly Market thing that said um 69% or whatever yesterday I bought gov CTO I feel like that's pretty he's literally live too talking about how they're going to shut down

00:26:07	this is good as [ __ ] bro about to shut down I mean I mean it's not even that the guy is literally he's like he's streaming Bro yeah this is good I'm also a USAC both nice nice you at 70k now un ironically like like actually what happens if the government shuts down I don't even what's it for it's it's basically like we can't like afford them or whatever something like that oh way yeah cuz like payments I mean that is insane going through something and they have to get funding no like they actually have to pay them

00:26:58	wles you bought this OG one yeah cuz this one ran to like Mills hold hostage though you're at 11% [ __ ] oh no I'm splitting bro I know it's going to [ __ ] move is this the OG OG one yeah this is the one that ran like hard as [ __ ] all right bet I when this run this [ __ ] ran to like three mil or some [ __ ] or five I don't know me see the chart what what botted it's botted narrative actually shuts down like even though like it's bearish does but I don't know I feel like if the government shuts down isn't that bullish

00:27:43	for crypto yeah cuz like all these like workers are going to get on Meme coins to try to make money you know real no I paper government CTO all right you just watched me and my friends trade a few narratives that you know were either news based or event based or things that just came out that looked half decent again you're just placing bets on narratives that you think May potentially start spreading around such as the government CTO like if the USA government were to have shut down I mean this would be talked about

00:28:16	everywhere government CTO would be a pretty good front run up a narrative to try to hold um this is pretty much all you're doing you're just trying to see out of all these coins that are coming out which of these coins actually has a good story story behind a good narrative that if it were to be shared people can start relating to it whether it be like peanut the squirrel dying and getting [ __ ] taken away and he was famous on Tik Tok what a great narrative the Luigi coin I mean the guy killed the

00:28:42	multi-billion dollar CA Health company you know um what other narratives have been like super obvious I mean goat I guess you know being the first AI coin to kind of start the AI shift of um creating a whole new meta it's not even like a it's not even a meta anymore it's its own category now of coins um every once in a while you get these really really good obvious narratives for example unicorn fart do like this guy who's a Bitcoin hater silver/gold old Boomer who makes YouTube videos on silver and gold made a meme coin you get

00:29:13	do you get what I'm trying to go at now it's just you're simply just placing bets on narratives you may think could be good you may think other people while something's good but you also need to understand that some of these narratives may not be as good as you think so you need to get out as quick as this oh my God Asian made a coin Asian Andy actually yeah filled he didn't make it that's why I didn't buy it who's Asian Andy this guy's like he didn't make it though yeah he didn't make this one it takes a significant amount of

00:29:45	money for me to risk my but hole right send me Supply you're using my name give me half hey I'm chilling okay connected my wallet is he trying to buy or he's looking for oh if I get rugged by my own viewers oh wait he's actually buying the coin very sad y I'm down bad on it right now holy [ __ ] it is I don't know how this works I have 46 so I'm putting 045 please connect please enter a valid amount to trade what does this mean oh my God he he's trying to buy it trying to buy it bro refresh the page I

00:30:25	don't get it man I don't understand I'm too I don't understand how this wallet [ __ ] Works send me your wallet I'll send you some what is wait my salana wallet how does this work wait let me uh all right here let me give you my wallet drop a 50 make your own coin of all right you just saw me make like 20 so off of a big twitch streamer YouTuber Asian Andy who was live streaming and showing a coin on pump fun and I was able to front run him buying um now he just dropped his wallet and I am aware

00:30:58	as a experienced you know Salon trencher that somebody's going to make a 10 20 50% 80% wallet and they're going to send him Supply um it's pretty expensive thing to do it's like 2030 sold to send him that much Supply so you know if you're just starting out probably don't recommend doing that there's always going to be someone that's going to do it so I'm refreshing his wallet trying to see okay I want to be able to buy as soon as that they send him Supply and you can see here what happens dude maybe the other ones are

00:31:24	not popping up oh my God I got to sell quick how do I he's he's about to sell oh my god without him without him oh my God he s oh my God he sold what's up which one oh too you got to up the slipage you got to up the slipage hurry up bro 11k what the hell is that I'm God it's at 11k it's worth 11k wait it's volatile wait it's volatile right now oh it's dude it was 11 then eight what the [ __ ] is going on how do I cheat does someone have to see a for the one try to switch I don't know which one that is I have no idea the one looking

00:32:01	man no it's not that's guys can you I'm not RIS my yes that's the one he's up 11k bro how I what the [ __ ] it is this one it he did it oh God somech your oh my God no I can help on atet no wait it's just no higher bro oh my god he has 53 Soul now he's [ __ ] going dude and as you can saw I just made another 20 Soul by front running him I tracked his wallet on potion tracker right because he had posted his wallet so I ended up tracking it as soon as I saw that he sold I ended up buying the dip on the coin he sold

00:32:43	people usually start like send it without them or whatever as you can see I got a 5 cry with five soul went all the way up to like 50 Soul 10x uh you know usually not able to extract that much off a pump fun that's at 50k so I made like 20 so on that and we just keep going with the stream I have wait what if you just start trading [ __ ] coins tonight oh my God no his what's his what's hiset oh no dude I don't we got to find the wallet that he sold on yeah the one that he One Clip this is this is one of them that is

00:33:18	one of them shut up or just [ __ ] snipe it [Music] if he sold no no if he sold on fa3 on that wallet then then it is I'm too [ __ ] to know how to sell this [ __ ] that you see me take like half an hour to sell it his tokens Wen popping up live selling it take half an hour you'll have enough time to sell it yourself I might be the perfect person to make the coin I might be the perfect person to make the coin this is when sw's launch yesterday we're looking at the streamer like 30k try to sow God could made more money I could

00:33:58	have made more money it's okay I what's a ticker what is that a tick what's a ticker guys what's a ticker all right I just want to kind of do a little break I know a lot of this is really hectic information not very beginner friendly so let's break it down asan said he was going to launch a token so I ended up opening my sniper ball on tegram Nova which is the best sniper on chain and I put his deployer wallet right so pretty much anything that that wallet would deploy a lot of people don't really do

00:34:26	this information by the way so um um and actually giving away some pretty good saive but I mean you made it to like what 30 minutes in the video you kind of deserve this at this point uh running a sniper to buy anything that that wallet deploys and I'm buying I'm running a five Soul tip with the one Soul fee so wasting about $1,500 now to try to get 80 entry and um yeah well uh we'll see what happens he doesn't end up making a coin though but there is something else I do in this video that is pretty 200 IQ and uh watch

00:34:57	this oh I 100 now that's a real brother that's what I like to hear that's why I'm about to give them not R me it's my own dog guys what salana Twitter post do I have a cat they tweet tweet about sent that huge coin from five months ago went from so as you can see I just bought some supply of his dog right there was a coin that was made 30 minutes ago it was completely dead and he was he was popping up his screen on stream right so he was going to see these tokens in his wallet so I pretty much just sent him like 1,000 bucks at

00:35:43	current prices and I was taking a bet that he would show this on stream look there's a strat that nobody absolutely nobody is going to talk to you about but if you have the capital to send these streamers these big people money like when Andrew Tate twed a wallet I mean whoever sent him that initial Supply ended up bagging out in my last video profit sent Nolan like 20% of a coin and profit ended up making like 300K on that coin like you can do a lot by just sending Supply to people you don't even

00:36:12	have to like you don't have to Dev coins you don't have to do that you literally just send supply of existing coins to people and just Watch What Happens 15 like from 15 million to 100 million just now what what's called send come on yeah oh wow oh my God what do Co just get K salana posted about it yeah literally in like salana and toi in like an hour the [ __ ] is going on why how's this keep was it at like a few hours ago 15 yeah Jesus that is crazy they like bull post it you will make a lot of M

00:37:02	just TR little piece of the pie if you're really going to take a ride on me little bit of piece of the P why are there like seven coins of me here there's like seven coins of me here this is crazy how much do you weigh like I I lost like 15 lbs but I still I feel fat still I'm getting like acne I've had more acne now than when I was like 16 dude the guy that's spamming you've already sold your butthole it's theirs is kind of stressing me out please I will help you do it fairly so everyone wins and make sure it's legit and not

00:37:40	sniped all legit I I can make you 500k plus you go to school for like 12 years become a [ __ ] surgeon and then you probably make like 500 Grand a year that it's not happy guys I'm not risking my ass off open a coin for the poor people the thing is that half the people that like 90% of the poor people are going to end up [ __ ] losing money bro it's not guys I uh I got a nice family uh I'm really happy seeing my parents every day listen to the scam donations they will steal money from you just deploy the

00:38:19	coin yourself and don't show it so right there I just got bailed out by TTS who said check your wallet they sent you Sasha which is a coin I had just sent them he bought Sasha they sent me Sasha no I don't think he bought anything he just said think he was trying to buy oh my God yo per on on holy [ __ ] I yo I just made 32 soul on a 50k topper what dude he always bu like off my name and [ __ ] go and gam the [ __ ] 50k toer made 30 Soul yeah look how much he invested he invested eight bands wait what no he bought he bought

00:39:13	earlier then sold no yeah yeah I like bro I have a SK that's it we took 15 sold to 175 sold the wallet will be down below you can go ahead and check the chain check all the trades yourself I am no longer using this wallet though so do not try to track it do you guys want an episode two of this where we take 175 Soul all the way up to 1,000 Soul 10,000 soul I don't know I'd love to do a series of like one soul to a million but I tried doing one Soul challenges and I fail every single time it's really hard

00:39:42	the 15 Soul was kind of like the gold spot for me uh hope you guys enjoy this video hope you picked up a few things um there's a lot of things on Chain man a lot of different skills on chain that you can use lot of different tools you can use and I hope you picked some of that up from today's video neox and Nova links in description below potion will be closing on Christmas so 3 days to sign up to join potion um pretty much it orangey and I'm out peace

---------------
00:00:10	what's up guys welcome to the interview with profit did you mean to put 10 mil and not 100 Mil no I meant to put 100 Mil all right Prophet you ready yeah I'm ready okay cool let's get into this uh so first we're going to go ahead and ask him a list of questions that I have pre-made for the video and then we will um I also make Dy YouTube by the way chat and then we'll go ahead and ask him some twitch questions so all right profet what were you doing before crypto um before crypto was playing fortnite with mostly everybody in Grand

00:00:43	we were just playing fortnite just grinding like everybody else like playing comp playing Z Wars and all that when did you start crypto uh late 2021 when did you start like like I'm I'm assuming like nfts and stuff yeah nfts were you good at nfts uh no not really I mean I hit a couple drops but I wasn't really good so like would you say like when you started meme coins and like onchain trading that was like when you really took off yeah of course and when was that um right after Pepe last year so

00:01:22	like may like May what were like that's when I started [ __ ] coining really did you like buy Pepe was that like your first ever ever going no I didn't I never bought Pepe like what made you get into it uh like enties were dying and The Meta was shifting like Pepe was running insanely uh I think I don't even know what what did Pepe go to in the first one it went it went it went insane they did an insane run obviously and everybody was transitioning from n to Shin so I just had to adapt what were like the biggest factors

00:01:58	in kind of like helping you adapt like what did you do differently from everybody else like obviously you've been trading before Photon before pump fun and all that right yeah so like what did that look like back in the day I mean it was just a long it was a learning process experience of just a lot of L's I was in groups asking people like to help me get better like I was actually like just a straight up Noob like I didn't know anything last year and like through experience it just got it just got easier and better what

00:02:29	would you tell like your herself now like after you know looking at all these trenches and spending countless time in here like what would you tell yourself uh to get out your comfort zone when trading and be confident in trades okay how important has like your friend group been and like the people that you're surrounded with uh in trading oh extremely important I don't think I could even like go a day without trading without being in VC and being with people like with like-minded goals it's like it just makes everything much

00:02:57	easier everybody has the same dreams it's like what what exactly do you mean by like you wouldn't you couldn't do this without them like what what is it about being in a call with people that helps you out so much um most of the times they catch things I don't catch cuz obviously as one person you can't catch you can't catch everything by yourself you need to be in like a group or something but being in VC everybody just shouts a different call everybody just has their own opinion it's also good to hear different opinions on coins

00:03:23	sometimes it's bad sometimes it's good but it's always hear good to hear like Confluence around the coin okay I think your pump vision is Frozen by the way we're not seeing like any new paers come up oh my fault I think I was um yeah so so what does this look like by the way like what is your data day routine look like like what are you doing are you sitting all day on mem scope uh yeah mostly just sitting on mem scope and waiting for Wallace to buy why do you have I see you have filters on why do

00:03:47	you have filters and what filters uh the only filter I have is market cap because like a lot of spam pump ones get deployed I don't even go past 10K so do you ever feel like you miss anything like an El tweet or anything like no I mean Elon tweet I just I'll reset filter it doesn't really matter okay so you reset filters when like there's like a big tweet going on and then you don't get as aids with 10K market cap yeah you can also just have a tab with no filters have one with filters that's s what

00:04:24	filters do you have on about to graduate uh 25k Mar cap that's it and the age age and age and snipers and on graduated why why snipers what does that do uh I just don't like really buying bundle coins to be honest and plus uh re gave me those settings so just kind of use them before like pump fun and before Photon I want to get into that like what were like the trenches like like what exactly was like your trading how exactly did someone trade back in the day cuz I I didn't trade back then so what was that honestly I me

00:05:00	gr had like a completely different trading style than anybody else like for example we would only buy coins like say say this was on E it was on E we would only buy coins if it pumped like this and it dumped in one block and then we would buy here and like sell like right here for like a 10% gain is like we didn't really snipe coins on E we weren't trying to be early on E we were just trying to buy dips literally that's it what were you trading on F on was that Photon thing no we were using we were using Dex spy we were using banana

00:05:37	and thunder okay and when when Photon came out like did that really change the game for you like was everything just so much easier oh yeah of course trading terminal is just easy to navigate coins so you know you you don't only trade Soul you also trade e which a lot of people who are watching this video and even the stream probably don't do like would you say a lot of your Cooks still come from East and like other chains um no not really I haven't really been tuned into evm cuz just been like

00:06:08	kind of dead but there has been some insane Runners on base and yeah pretty much it like virtuals Pairs and like all the the different pump funds over there like wow XYZ all that just been some Runners cler yeah clanker that was bad for me um what would you say like your number one skill is like is it sitting here on new pairs and scanning or is it top last season like what what is best for you I think my best skill is just I I don't even know to be honest I just I just have like a lot of confidence when I trade like that's just

00:06:44	about it like if I think I'm if I know I'm going to lose on this coin or I don't know but if I do lose on a coin I just know I'm going to make it back on the next coin so and like most of the time I do lose on the coin like it revives cuz I just I just let it be a dead bag what was that moment where like you realize like oh [ __ ] it I'll just make it back on the next one like when did you realize like I'm actually good at this I can make a living off of this uh honestly I've been thinking like this

00:07:09	for like the last year okay like literally since like last December is how do you identify like all the [ __ ] and bad meme coins like are you clicking on all on any of these uh new pairs or are you just waiting for like anything that catches your eye any narrative what's the Strat here oh oh really I mean I was a scan right now now I wouldn't buy this Dev sold I wouldn't buy this this is already an old narrative Dev sold I would click on this dev has 1% I would check to Twitter uh it looks decent it just looks like like basic

00:07:50	[ __ ] I mean it has 1,500 followers probably just bought it um just based off this [ __ ] like I don't even want to buy this like all these snipers [Music] umed that funding like it's just it kind of he he dispersed for these bundle wallets it seems like Reus bundle wallets yeah like they bought this nuro coin I wouldn't I wouldn't buy this at all yeah okay um and so what exactly is a good mcoin like what would you identify as something good I don't I don't like buying Europe like this like fart Miss honestly I don't I

00:08:40	don't know what a good coin would be right now on mem scope I guess low Dev Holdings fairly new Twitter um good mutuals on the Twitter and speculation of it launching tonight I guess how important is it to know like the crypto like Twitter culture like know what CT is and stuff like that uh it is super important it's also super important to see who's chilling the coin who's actually in the coin cuz most of the time you if you see who's in the coin you can already tell how the coin is going to end and it kind of saves you from losing

00:09:18	money so you don't use um bux Neo so I'm curious here how you have like these holders are do you memorize wallets uh yeah you know 3 RS s like yeah exactly how many like you think you have like hundreds of wallets memorized um for the most part probably that's insane um can we look through like your recent trades and kind of go over them and like some of your losses some of your wins and the why is why you bought oh where where should I go for that to gu I mean these are just I just have a remaining okay

00:10:00	I can I don't know how Photon works I don't know are these like your most recent ones uh these are the ones I don't actually don't know how to filter by recent trades but I mean these are pretty recent anyways not sure how to okay let's go over yeah do that do that let's go over your biggest win on on this wallet so okay so up only okay so I want to talk a little bit about this coin for anyone who doesn't know uh Kobe who's like the biggest guy on CT um pretty much got sent supply of this he tweeted about it and then he burned all

00:10:38	his Supply let's talk about catching this type of coin what tools did you use to catch this super early um a while ey track bought extreme amount of the pump fun so it was obvious that he was going to send him Supply another okay okay gotcha so another trencher yeah okay gotcha so they set up token ready to send Kobe Supply and this is something that we've seen you do as well we've seen you buy a lot of supply of coins and send it to like X Y and Z Persona and I mean you did that with Nolan right yeah and I mean the these

00:11:16	these type of coins just pop off so how did you find that wallet of that person who who I guess started this coin just started seeing him on every holders list like he literally owns like every coin on a blockchain like he's just the goat so I just started tracking him you track it what water tracker do you use uh saler all right edit that out of the video editor you got to say potion okay anyways um okay gotcha so what I'm assuming just like insta filled you didn't get in on the pump fun it spawned

00:11:45	one mil no I I got in on a pump fun it filled after I bought but let me just double check U yeah I got I got in on pump fun oh wow yourent why is your entry so high is that because when cuz I no I bought again like later on like a few days later okay got you I gotta yeah and you made up 1.2k so off of this so what is like 300 Grand off of this trade yeah um it it kind of Pumped and then died after I wish I can just easily scroll in right here but it's going to reset my chart and yeah yes so but you're so fast on

00:12:32	I mean you could kind of see that kind of went went down was this like until he uh tweeted Kobe tweeted um no Kobe tweeted right here this is like this is like almost an hour after it's actually live and it went to zero um he sent like right here that's why he started pumping and people started people seen that Kobe posted the Addie before and still went down cuz people didn't think he would actually engage and then he burned it I want to talk about that real quick about like um coins that kind of have to get narrative

00:13:09	spread around different fnfs I mean we see this every day right with coins like whether it be like hey the Phantom founder deployed this X Y and Z ago right how do you play those coins out because obviously at the end of the day they're just like different fnf pump and dumps um I stay away from those coins honestly if it if it's someone I it it it just depends who's tweeting like if if I know this guy is like just trying to like just get an extra couple bucks I'll just stay away but usually usually someone

00:13:39	writing a thread like that it always ends up in a just a major PN D and if you're not early like if you're not early like sub 500k I wouldn't I wouldn't buy at all and and how how do you think this kind of works like where does it get started like the spread because obviously a lot of people watching this video a lot of people watching the Stream they want to know how to get in this early like for example um can you put up the coin that we had today the the lar SEC tax bill that went to like 4 mil oh what was that

00:14:11	called was that called was quick Buck quick QBC okay so for example this like this is a coin that you know it got spread super early like in one fnf and then people started catching on the narrative and then you know it ended being fake and just instad dump did you like what do you think about like this type of stuff like where can they find it early like how do you find it early uh well this this you just have to be in the meme scope or in the pump font trenches to find this early but I think I think honestly grinding

00:14:46	migrations also rather than just grinding this like side right here is way better cuz less things migrate so you have more time to do research instead of just finding a th000 coins right here do you still feel like that'll applies to people with very low portfolios like if I'm starting with one to five Souls that's still what I should be doing uh you know honestly you probably should be on this side but when you see something migrate you should probably take a break over here and do research regardless okay so if you're

00:15:13	starting out with the small Port go on the new pairs and grind that and what do you think I want to ask you what do you think is the skill difference here between like someone that just started like like csy for example what you don't even have to just be started but like what makes csy in your opinion different or like stacky what makes some different than like every other good any other trencher they're they're they're just like animalists like they just they they buy I think I think for the most part

00:15:40	they buy then research after and that's how they just so much earlier than other people cuz most people just research first and then buy so when you're already researching Cubs stack you already have 10% of each and it's migrating and then they just win and if the narrative is actually good they just they just scale out slowly they usually do like two so Clips just how yeah that obviously that comes with um okay for example Waddles and cupsy just bought this coin can you pull it up so what would you be what's your

00:16:12	opinion on this coin two trenchers that are very well known just bought polar just bought like let's talk about this right now it just came out you know 10 seconds ago what do you think there well the Twitter is restricted so I wouldn't buy it I usually research after csy buys cuz is he is he like a good indicator like is he one of your top wallets he's top qu yeah he is yeah for sure when he's trenching at least yeah but I'm not going to lie if it's migrating and he has 5% I just stay away I mean this was this was kind of obvious

00:16:43	drug cuz of right Twitter being restricted yeah yeah also the de probably deployed multiple times too I I guess oh well yeah they fund it from a mixer kind of kind of bearish so so you name your Wallets on Soul scan all like all the exchanges all the mixers yeah that helps you with like doing stuff like this like right understanding where wallets get funded from really fast yeah exactly my chat wants to know how your philon looks like this can you give them The Insider or no it's just it's just a dark reader

00:17:21	extension it's not even like it's just it's just everything is is it true that you got less input delay with this it's not true I've heard rumors that this makes it so that whatever you buy gets migrated first that's just not even the case I just like it so all my tabs are just dark okay if you say so um mode do you TR okay obviously there yes so you do track wallets you track Twitter's and socials I assume right like obviously uh do you track other socials and just Twitter like are you tracking elon's

00:17:53	Instagram elon's no actually Instagram's also a lot of money to be made if you have Instagram monitor to be honest okay so many like like open AI narratives usually appear there okay um do you track devs uh I track I track a couple like I try not to track Dev but the only devs are really track are like the ones that like extremely high market caps just in case they ever deploy again okay gotcha so like dryman for example when he rebot were you tra that wallet yeah yeah yeah okay um um if you just had to like get started

00:18:32	like where would you go to meet people like how would you make friends how would you like would you join certain Alpha discords like what are you doing to get started and meeting people um I would join paid groups I would go I would join potion I would join groups like potion pastel Vanquish shocked and I would try to get in pal Dent cam honestly pal Jor Camp is like a widespread of Traders and you can learn a lot from there to be honest how does someone new get into a group like this cuz now we're going from like paid

00:19:09	groups to like more private groups I mean honestly pal just he kind of just post invites on like Twitter and TG so it really is like open group you just just kind of got to be there gotcha uh how much time a day do you trade let's talk about your daily schedule what does that look like um wello recently I just well today I went to the gym so now I'm just going to I'm waking up at like 9:00 going to the gym at like 10:00 and getting on at like 11:00 and probably will get off at like 2:00 a.m. and that's it you're just sitting here

00:19:48	on mem scope all day waiting for narratives tracking wallets tracking Twitter trackers whatever yeah yeah yeah pretty much yeah all right give me the breakdown okay and give us the alpha left to right what's on your monitor right now this is my left monitor my right monitor is Discord full screen what you don't have like you have like your water tracker open what else you have open give us some soft all I mean I have TG open and I have all these tabs open and I just have I have grand General open

00:20:17	right now okay are you able to put up your skill by the way on this wallet like your doc one uh yeah sure okay so your 30-day Pano on this wallet yeah let's just go to 30-day p and kind of talk about the narratives that you trade this month so top trade on no on 30 days was no land this is even like this isn't really a trade I gave him all all the money so I burn it but let's talk about that though because like if it wasn't you it's going to be somebody else like you kind of forced this narrative to

00:20:47	happen on chain yeah yeah I mean I do regret it anyways but um why do you regret it I'm not going to lie I I kind of I definitely shouldn't have kept that much Supply and I also was nuking being an absurd amount if I'm being honest but if I didn't do it someone would have did it and just taken all the money so in the end in the end it obviously worked out but okay F let's so let's talk about opam what I don't know what this token is what was this uh this is a zero BR related token and this launched at

00:21:25	night and I was like the first byy I seen I seen this go live or not go live but it was like like 600k and I opened the Twitter and it was followed by the Zer bro Dev and they tweeted to ca so and I just blasted 50 soul and it started catching on like were you like it caught on like really quick were you a first TX or something like off migration not first TX but look it like it like migrated died and you can like see the candle where twe yeah it kind of like cut on here I want to talk about this you saw it migrate you

00:22:03	saw they had a Twitter that was followed by Zer Dev I assume you start tracking the Twitter once they buy they tweets yeah you buy yeah okay exactly I mean it was on the website too and also there was like top wallets that had a lot of zero bro but it seems they not the top wallet somewhere okay well yeah this wallet has 1.4 million Z bro that's say I don't know but on the day of launch there was a wallet that had like like 2% of zero bro that was top holder how often are you going on Soul scan and

00:22:38	checking the chain uh like every coin I buy you should always check the chain Co you buy you check Soul like me personally I don't like really check Soul you should you should always check the what what do you looking for on Soul scan like like me personally I'll look for like where de wallet got found it from if it needs the dev but like a lot of the narratives I'm buying don't need the dev yeah no that that that makes sense but like with these AI coins like you should always check the dev wallet you should always

00:23:09	check the holders you should see if the dev is deployed before if it's connected to rugs you should see if the holders um if there's bundle wallets you should see if they're Reus bundle wallets and if they like ran up a rug before that cuz a lot of these teams do use Reus bundle wallets and they like slip up and you could kind of tell us rug beforeand okay let's go back to your sh what was your biggest loss this month um you PR realiz piano on the Arrow what which one uh left left left I yeah one

00:23:48	more what was this coin honestly don't even know this oh this is a rookie xpt narrative rookie xpt he launched this this was an fnf pump and dump yeah exactly and I got caught yo but you you did not just get caught I mean why hold to like little zero what was this about I mean there's just no point in ever there was just no point in selling down here like what do you mean when I'm already I'm already down that much like I kind of see it as like the r are still better for me to hold than me to sell

00:24:21	back for that Soul like I was already down bad here and he was still holding the coin like the The Narrative was still the same down here is the narrative still the same now uh no The Narrative is completely shot dead because rookie sold he Burn yeah yeah I'm pretty sure he sold and also it's it's just named test and everybody didn't like that so didn't matter I I guess like you you literally held for like zero like z z zero yeah you held for days yeah I mean this was just one of those trades where like I

00:24:56	think this narrative is good R is good for me um I'm going to hold to zero and just try to make the Lost back on a different coin I mean it's a good entry right now you should probably yeah this is I probably could get way more Supply I had I see how much Supply I actually had oh4 point I barely even had like I had 2.8% I probably get that for literally the Sol asso right here that's a good RR okay let's go over another big loss um M3 M3 this is actually a good coin I actually own some Co this is a good coin

00:25:36	so what do you think went wrong here cuz I actually I own this coin VC VC coms went wrong here what does that mean we kind of we kind of thought it was uh it wasn't really like meteor that launched it but in reality it was really just it really is just meteor team that launched it like week and also they were tax farming which was very annoying and there was also a sniper that was up yeah like yeah this guy made a mill there was a sniper that was constantly just destroying the chart and also I didn't like how the the ks

00:26:13	kol's got toly on this which I didn't like if you held right now you would be up yeah I would be up I had a 57 average with four and or Soul so yeah it'll be up really good people in my chat are asking me how do you get in so early on every coin um honestly most of the time I'm not even the earliest like there's someone I'm tracking that's earlier than me so let's go back to your got oh my bad yeah no you're good you're good uh YNS okay but you also held this to literal zero what's like why actually

00:26:49	hold are you just like like honestly are you just like too rich to care about some of this no it's not even that it's the Tik Tok meta was going on and and like I'm literally top y you top blasted I mean I'm literally like I was DCA I bought it One Clip actually bought it one clip it literally went to zero and then rebounded so I thought maybe if it went to zero again it probably have another chance but I kind of just this in case anybody ever ran it back and it seems like nobody cared about the

00:27:24	coin after a week so yeah this is just another one of chance or those coins where U I'm just I think the narrative is good RR and I'm just going to make it back on a different coin I want to talk about real quick Copy Traders what do you think about them like what do you think specifically about people that say you just make all your money off copy Traders um I I don't care I I think I am a copy Trader that's that's literally what I think I am but I'm not a auto copy Trader I mean for some people I

00:27:51	would I will automatically copy trate cuz I know they're like like usually always early or better at doing research than me but for the most part I think if you're copy trading through a bot you're you're you're us you're just asking to get to get rent and lose money but like you're genuinely like Okay so let's run it through you know look stacky just bought tear right oh he just sold already um for example you do the same thing I do stacky buys you look at what it is cupsy buys you look at what it is yeah exactly

00:28:23	half the time half the time I'm I'm letting other people find the narratives for me like I'm even and then you just BL yeah yeah I'm not even like like fart for example stacky just bought 10 Soul fart bir uh he already sold I mean for I don't like buying like narratives like this like this is just a fart coin like C play D and yeah I mean this guy also just rooked so like this this also like this guy just launched a coin I mean now he has 700 followers but before he had 34 followers like and it was like kind of a

00:28:59	ufd Coplay and it would just seemed like an obvious Farm because because of the let's talk about ufd did you play that at all uh no I was actually watching a show while it was constantly going up and so you still do like watch TV you still play video games like you still take time off yeah of course but um this is also another a grand Miss where vccs got the best of us and we didn't think the narrative was that good to you I didn't think it was that good either but a lot made a good amount of money on

00:29:36	it yeah it was an insane coin though this is literally if you look through these top Traders you recognize these wallets like without them being named like it's so cra I've seen this wallet before but I don't really know who it is I think it's a me I think it's another Orca type bot um all right for example teral sorry sorry truth terminal just tweeted truth terminal just tweeted you think it fails uh no I don't I don't even like care for truth terminal tweets anymore why do you think fcoin flipped

00:30:10	goat I think The Narrative of fcoin flipping goat itself was also like a good enough Catalyst to push it higher and like it just it just makes like the goat the goat holders just cope even more um also the narrative it was like the first it introduced so I mean I guess it was it was kind of a good narrative itself but I'm not going to lie 1 billion is actually insane I don't I don't I don't really know who was buying it that that high but went that High um can we go back to sh and just look at one more trade yeah

00:30:45	so let's look at uh your biggest win for the month what was it so let's do let's do like the biggest like average you know like Quant for or Doge father I think there's a really good example what people dream of doing $700 into 82k Elon tweet right so you just bought off Elon tweeting yeah me I just bought off Elon tweeting and I was I was the first to migrate so I mean I just I kind of just the first to migrate how exactly do you become the first to migrate oh that's a good question maybe ask Allan that question and think he

00:31:20	would have an answer for you okay anyways um I think that's pretty much all I have to ask you from me personally but now I want to go over to my twit chat and have them ask questions um we're interviewing profit right now from Grand FF honestly like one of the best onchain Traders one of my personal like big Inspirations like tier one glaze type of thing so let's just I want you guys to uh ask some questions in chat and let's answer them who do you copy trade um when it comes to pump funds usually usually cubsy sentos

00:31:59	zy all like the trenchers if anybody in gr ever sell something I just I just buy it uh K's like people were more P than me like people were more on chain pole than me like like PO for example like P is also a good wallet to copy trade people from The Troop where where they have like a lot of Confluence the troop is really good for Confluence so what does confluence mean like when you guys like get bullet together basically like it's like if you guys are just all like building a narrative together like you

00:32:34	guys are all finding price Targets in mind for the coin what was your what was your price target for peanut like what did you think peanut would go to um actually I don't I don't think I bought peanut until binance yeah I don't I didn't think peut and I also took a loss in the coin yeah like yeah I I don't even I didn't buy peanut at all these P holy [ __ ] yeah I should have do you ever feel like you're gambling rather than investing yeah like 80% of the time I never really invest in coins for like

00:33:12	a long-term hold so most of the time is just gambling so I mean is it skill based I mean you never lose though so like I I do lose like I lose a lot actually it's just like okay but like the losses my wins are better yeah like I mean I just keep my losses to a minimum like I always like always keep a 50% stop loss always you don't no you don't never or no but like usually like I don't have big losses like like my biggest loss is 50k like I don't I don't have like in retrospect 10K losses like how much yeah yeah these

00:33:51	are like 50 so buys like just have a lot of like these losses I don't do you track my wallet I don't over leverage yeah I I do track your wallet let's go s have you ever copy traded me yeah oh [ __ ] when you snipe when you snipe a coin usually I or when you try to snipe a coin I usually look at it when I open token profile yeah um let's see what other questions are there here okay yo how much Soul did you start with um I started with zero soul back in 201 21 and I just I meant to an nft for a friend his name is Veil I meant to nft

00:34:35	for him and I hit a rare and he gave me a percentage so he gave me like 2K and you turned that 2K obviously into many millions so how like just throughout the years but I also lost it many times like I zeroed out many times how did you get money did you work IRL jobs what did you do um well I never went to complete zero I just went to like a low standpoint like like a couple hundred dollar and I just just worked back for it did you ever honestly back in nfts it was way easier to build a low port or

00:35:13	not way easier but if you had like $30 you didn't even have money you didn't even need to have money back in the back in Mt you could just grind Whit less for people and just get paid like that like there's many other ways to make money in Mt from Z how many times were you um [ __ ] I had a question hear that I wanted to ask on okay obviously like a lot of people like they they keep losing and they don't feel like there's like really a chance like what do you what do you suggest to these people that are just

00:35:39	like failing over and over again uh to keep trying to build confidence experience is the best teacher you're going to lose before you win how many times are you going to lose I mean there's no there's no set times how many how many times you're going to lose before you win this this is It's it depends how long you it takes you to get the click of it if you keep trying over and over and you keep failing you're going to learn from your mistakes I seen a cooker Tweet someone said in pass that was actually actually a good tweet somebody

00:36:11	asked ask him how do you how do you make how do you make good Connections in the space if you were a fortnite pro it looks like you get the freest hand out like stacky and Notch how does a random like me get terrible RNG and get my way up to that level it seems near impossible I mean like stacky and know like they were already like friends beforehand um yeah it's kind of the thing with like a lot of like us like we we didn't like maybe we didn't know each other but like we knew of each other yeah like and we

00:36:39	we like we were just like Associates like we we knew we knew if we wanted something together we would we would do it right um like what do you recommend for anyone that like didn't come like obviously you know fortnite kids kind of run the show it's like what do you recommend for anyone who didn't come from that it's true though um honestly you should try to find your own like you should probably bring some old friends yourself with some like IRS and stuff right that's what I that's what I say all you should

00:37:10	you should try to get your own friends and bring them into it and set some goals together it's much easier to grind with people you already know than meeting new people you said that you think this is gambling so how do you think people can build consistency what do you think what does he think the skill in it is I don't think there's much skill to my trading personally I think I think it just like it comes down to whether the people I'm tracking like uh honestly I just think I just think you need to you need to learn the

00:37:49	chain before you before you get I don't know how I'm trying to formulate this sentence I think think learning the chain is the best skill you can have to to lower the the consistency of you gambling like what does learn the chain mean like can you specify this for a little bit get familiar with like fundings get familiar with with um what was I about to say get familiar with like this tab right I I use this tab a lot this is a good tab this just breaks down the simplest terms um get familiar with

00:38:29	uh how devs usually fun like I don't I don't like just get better at reading the chain like txy like wallet wise like I think it's just important to have when buying these coins cuz most of the time like if you don't do the research you're mostly just gambling on whether people like it or not okay so I mean also also just doing more research too can minimize the gambling okay yeah how long do you think meme coins last someone that's looking to start today should they even bother how much longer wait what you cut out how

00:39:08	much longer of this pump fun trenches do we have um I honestly don't know it's a good question but you should you should Max Extract while you can what do you think just like a b Ark definitely another 6 months until like until like summertime where it normally slows down oh my though I like to hear that I like to hear that um okay I think that's pretty much it um we want to know Propet after this obviously I mean you've already made it bro like congratulations obviously I hope you keep cooking though but what's

00:39:47	next bro like what do you want to do in life after this honestly I have no idea I haven't I haven't thought that far really kind of just taking a day by day and just doing what I can every day Monaco 2025 oh yeah that I mean that's the goal of course um but I have to sit here every day anyway people want to know how old you are I don't know if you want to Doc that though I already said it before on rally stream I'm 18 so you're 18 yeah what the [ __ ] yo my qu is wow that's dude do you know how crazy that

00:40:22	is like holy [ __ ] dude wow you [ __ ] made it that is great what type of car do you drive I don't have a car like yo you're 18 that is so crazy what the [ __ ] wow um okay cool is there anything that you want to say to end the video I think if you're just a new Trader you just need to build confidence that's that was that's just my my advice what's the quote of the without confidence you can't you can't you can't win the trade without confidence is that the quote of the day yeah of course and you you can't miss a

00:41:01	lucky day if you're here every day that's my favorite profit quote Yeah I mean you can never miss a lucky day if you're here every day like can't complain about missing something if you're not here so all right bro I appreciate it thank you so much for doing the interview bro like you are actually the goat I hope you know that no problem man you're you're the goat bro n dude also for anyone who doesn't know profet I tweeted out that thing that giveaway for the homeless people profit Lally donated

00:00:00	it seems like everybody is making millions of salana meme coins in today's video I'm going to show you exactly how you can copy some of these traders that are making millions of dollars on Solana I promise you if you watch this video entirely you are going to learn everything it takes to actually identify good coins and not lose all your money it's going to take some time if you're just starting you're not going to make a million dollars overnight I know some people may make it seem that way but the

00:00:23	truth is it's not Millions overnight it is a process it is a grind you can go back on my channel and look at the videos that I had 9 months ago I was a Noob Trader 9 months later I would say I've proved myself to be a pretty decent Trader so far anyways let's get into the video first thing you're going to need is this screen right here this is Neo bullex this is where all the new coins are coming out the main reason you want this screen here is because anytime there is a coin that is performing

00:00:47	really well you want to go ahead and be able to pick out who the good Traders are and there's a few cool features that you can do on neox so let's go ahead here head over to the graduated section of neox and go to market cap let's go head and put any token with a 100 one of the $1 million market cap and we got a few here fcoin white paper was a very very very popular trade today that a lot of Traders took so I think what we can go ahead and do is go here to the top traders of this token and this token

00:01:17	right here is Jasper this was another one today that was a um a popular trade amongst traders that you can also do the same thing on I actually lost 8K on this token today when I was actually up but anyways we're not going to we're not going to specifically talk about this here um for example sample fart coin white paper right you can go here to the top Trader section and what you can do is click on this wallet and you're going to rename the wallet you're going to rename this FW TT or whatever you want

00:01:40	to name it for me this means you know fart coin white paper top Trader that's what TT means for me next after Gathering the wallet on Neo bulock I'm going to head over to SEO and I'm going to search the wallet on SEO because I don't want to be tracking him if he got one lucky play as you can see here in the last 30 days he has lost $112,000 so I'm not going to take the next step with this guy which is fully tracking his wallet but I will keep him on neox named FW top Trader because well that's what he was let's go ahead here

00:02:11	the second wallet FW tt2 he was the second top Trader on this token head over back to seow put his wallet in the system token p&l let's check his 30-day p&l you could check all but the metas change so quickly okay so I can't track this wallet it may be a bot I'll keep it named but I will you know I'll put a bot emoji I usually do this on every single bot that I track so boom put robot let's go here we can just copy this wallet go CEO token piano 30 days also cannot track this wallet for some reason um all

00:02:44	right let's go over to Jasper where is Jasper right here Dam I cannot believe how terribly I played this token by the way and look look at that the top Trader from fart white paper the bot quote unquote is also a top Trader on Jasper so I think these are like two really good things that we can correlate with each other and kind of start renaming this wallet and kind of naming him a good Trader cuz this bot here is also you know top Trader of Jasper so FW plus Jasper tt2 gu what I will name this

00:03:11	wallet and I will write it down and now there's another wallet here I don't know why it's not letting me actually oh there we go okay I think we were getting some errors witho I just refreshed the page um this wallet doesn't have that many trades has only really had a good trade on Jasper so I won't go ahead and even name his wallet um but I can go ahead here right I hope you're getting the idea and go through all of these wallets until I find a Hidden Gem and a Hidden Gem can be somebody that's made

00:03:37	you know really good amount of money this month and once I find a good wallet like that oh look look for example this guy's up 300K this month that's pretty good you know pretty good Trader um let's go ahead and name him Jasper tt3 300K so now I know that you know 300K 30-day pnl you can put whatever emojis you want him for this guy let's put a dog cuz that's a token that was traded and now all of his trades will be popped up as a dog emoji on the chart like as you can see all these emojis here this

00:04:04	is a feature on Neo Bull X which is really what makes it the best decks possible for trading is that you can see every trade of everybody that you track and that's one of the features that you know makes bulex Neo like so so good to use among like any other decks and now that you have this wallet you know you found a wallet that makes 300K in the last 30 days just alltime p&l let's go ahead and check it 382k new your wallet probably and so now the next step is to go to potion track and there's a few

00:04:29	different tiers of potion tracker in the first link down below there will be a link to this page right here this is the of potion and real quick this is the free Discord access plus wallet tracker so you will get this product right here but you can only track up to five wallets and you'll also get free access to our Discord um which doesn't come with much but if you want all the other tools that we have in potion such as RCC tracker and the like 50 to 100 plus mem toin tools that I use every day when I

00:04:54	trade you have until Christmas to get them uh When Christmas Comes December 25th we are closing the Discord for a bit of time while we restructure some inner things so last chance to get into potion but our potion tracker will be up permanently um a few different options here you can get the starter tier which allows you to track 20 wallets Pro 100 advanc 250 and whe allows you to track up to 500 anyways once you get one of these tiers you can go ahead and try out the free one if you want you are going

00:05:19	to find this page here and you're going to spawn here my wallet and you're going to go ahead and add a wallet in the top right you name this wallet so for example this wallet that we just found I'll go ahead and add them nickname I will do 300K 3D day okay I know that this means in my head that he made 300K in the last 30 days and he's a pretty good Trader so you know Color Him custom tag no name because I don't know who this wallet is also I'll give you guys a tip real quick if you actually do want

00:05:46	to find whose wallet somebody belongs to sometimes pretty rare but sometimes you actually can get lucky and search the wallet on Twitter which may actually sometimes lead to somebody tweeting it out as you can see right here it looks like this guy um did he deploy this token I wonder if he deployed it hold on let me go ahead and check that real quick cuz that's additional good information regarding the token wow this token is just straight up mooning I play this thing so bad go here to the pump

00:06:12	phun and let's go to the de wallet and the de wallet is DMV not the same okay I just wanted to see if he had deployed that token Jasper just hit 4.2 mil wow I really really played this so bad had an average of a 1 mil entry and ended up losing on it somehow I would be up very good right now that is very unfortunate anyways let's not Dell in the past because sometimes you know there are going to be plays where you lose money and you know sitting there and complaining really isn't going to give you anything beneficial so once you're

00:06:43	tracking his wallet or anyone's wallet right now you can see everything they're buying and selling which is the most important part now let's talk about something else real quick okay you should not be trading alone you should always be trading in a group of people and you should be tracking the people that that you are trading with because now you can go ahead and see you know if you're in a call with like your boy jery and Jery's like yo guys look at this I found a cook you know cuz you're scanning new pairs and with new pairs

00:07:05	it's like look how many coins are coming out a second like I could lose that cook that Jeremy's talking about but you know if I trust my boy Jeremy I can just go ahead here and copy the ca right that Jeremy's talking about and I can go to Nova to buy or I can go to bulex P CA and check out what he's talking about this is why it's so important to trade with good Traders but that's one of my favorite things to do when trading is you know the Nova feature to autoby which we'll talk about in a bit is so

00:07:29	clutchy literally just copy the ca from your tracker paste it there enter boom a buy see orange you buy and then boom I can sell and there you go now we're going to be talking about something else okay so now you know about how to find these Traders from these top tokens on Neo you know how to check their p&l on cow and you know that you need to track them on potion tracker another feature of potion tracker you can do is you can go ahead and right click the wallets update them with colors uh and add

00:07:54	custom tags so you can track like certain fnf wallets that you may find some wallets that are linked to each other and a ton of different things but just because you're finding this wallet please hear me out do not copy trade these wallets like do not automatically buy what they're buying do not set up a copy trading bot because you'll lose money a lot of these wallets were just going to rinse you copy trading a lot of them you don't know their trading style yet so what is the benefit of copying

00:08:15	these wallets well when you have the same 10 20 different wallets buying the same token you're going to be like holy this might be a cook you're going to look into it and now there also comes a benefit when you're tracking people like cupsy like stacky like Urus like Waddles like these hard or trench Grinders whose wallets I'll leave in the description down below do not copy these people but if you want to learn how to trench and how to actually like be a good pump on Trader you should be studying what cupsy what stacky what all

00:08:40	these people are buying consistently day in day out 10 plus hours a day and eventually you're going to like recognize that there is a pattern and all these tokens kind of do align in some way whether it be like narratives narrative shifting something amongst all these tokens is good about them and is the reason that all these Traders are able to make such consistent money but yeah basically do not copy trade them trust me you will get rinse I've tried copy trading wallets and you will lose your money do not copy trade wallets use

00:09:08	it for information for example there is a huge token coming out that everyone's talking about it's pengu the pudgy Penguins token everyone wants to get a good entry on it and I'm tracking you know hundreds of wallets so when I see my wallets buying penu token I'm going to be like holy copy CA blast the into it using Nova bot you know Nova's going to give me the fastest fi cuz it's genuinely like the fastest bot on Solana I'm just going to get such a good entry and hopefully make a ton of money off pengu coin cuz it will

00:09:33	instantly go to billions so hopefully you know I'm able to get like a sub 1.5 Bill entry on it uh using my water tracker using the tools like looking at like open book for snipers and a whole ton of different stuff that's way more complex point of this video is to copy these good Traders how to actually understand what is good in the market what is not good so let's talk about Nova I know I just said don't copy trade now we're going to go a little bit back let's say you find a Hidden Gem wallet

00:09:58	that you're like holy this wallet like barely loses it's super lowkey no one is copy trading them the way you can tell this is by the way when you click on a wallet right for example if this wallet right here were to buy there'd be like a ton of buys right after like instantly um I'll kind of show you what that guys what that looks like because unfortunately you know wow and look look here on my CT tracker Jost just locked his Jasper tokens for a year which is just insane to think about so what ises

00:10:22	Jasper at now Jasper's at 4 mil it's just green wicking now 4.3 actually insane ah man I played this so bad but anyways let say you find a Hidden Gem of a wallet what you can do on Bots like Nova is actually set up a copy tra even though we just talked about not doing this but I think that if you're manually like looking at the wallet that you're copy trading and you're manually keeping up with it there is a good chance you don't get absolutely rinsed also as long as you you know like are just on top of it like

00:10:48	manually like you have to be looking I don't really recommend like leaving these copy trades on by themselves so do/ copy trade on Nova open a new task right and put a wallet so let's let's use Frosty J's wallet for example right copy his wallet exact copy trading whatever follow sells follow buys and I can start the task and anytime he buys something I will also be buying but I don't recommend this only if you find a Hidden Gem of a wallet and you are confident it is going to make you good money we pretty much just talked about

00:11:16	pretty much everything you need to know when it comes to copying good Traders this video is really not too difficult to understand you're going to lose money when you first start trading Salon meme coins it is called tuition this is not an instant money glitch but if you really put the time and effort you can make genuine millions of dollars before this is up you have maybe a few months to really really really get into this and I know people that started and in their first week they're absolutely

00:11:40	cooking but they're not trading alone they're not being NPCs they're actually putting in the time and learning not blindly following other people's calls you need to do your own research you need to actually lock in on this yeah you know there's so many different plays that come from like Twitter tracker for example which is a tool available in potion you know when Ela mus tweet something or for example oh my God I'm going to tell you guys a crazy cook that happened today Drake tweeted a meme coin let's talk about this real

00:12:03	quick so Drake it came up on my Twitter tracker followed this page right here with which had a CA in the bio I was able to copy that from the Twitter tracker and make a little bit profit on it I made 2.5k I had a pretty bad entry considering it was at 1 mil went all the way up to 13 now it dumped cuz you know Drake's Twitter got hacked he didn't actually tweet the ca like it wasn't really Drake but you know it's place like those that I can slowly stack with my portfolio with you know whether it be

00:12:30	scanning 247 for new pairs looking for new coins or just sitting on my hands waiting for a good coin to come out waiting for like a Twitter tracker play a wallet tracker play something I don't need a force plays I can sit on my hands and not have to trade anything there is no rush to lose money there is a good cook every single day so just wait like genuinely sometimes you just need to wait please do not trade alone you are going to get rinsed get together with like a group of your irls group of like
